<br /><span class="h2line2">A RAINY NIGHT.</span></h2>
<p>A dismally wet and cold September day had
come early to a close and thick darkness had
settled down an hour since, when the horse attached
to a heavy, canvas-covered, two-wheeled
emigrant wagon stopped, at its driver&rsquo;s command,
before an inhospitable looking house,
from one window of which a feeble light was
shining. The rain splashed drearily, the wind
moaned in a ghostly way about the structure
whose dim outlines were just visible, and flapped
the canvas over the wagon fitfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The barking of a gruff-voiced dog from somewhere
near the house gave certain sign that the
arrival of the cart had been noticed by that
animal, as a tall, broad shouldered boy sprang
lightly down from the vehicle and walked briskly
toward the door of the gloomy building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, never mind, Ring,&rdquo; spoke a young,
but full and pleasant voice from the front of
the wagon, as a large dog that stood beneath
growled deep in its throat in answer to the
barking of the other canine. Instantly the dog
was quieted and at the same moment came the
sound of knocking at the door of the partially
lighted house. A full minute passed, and the
knocking was vigorously repeated before there
was a response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t a tavern any more; we can&rsquo;t
keep ye,&rdquo; said a man who put his head out,
before the caller could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Eagle tavern, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the boy
inquired calmly, and the light through the half-open
door showed him to be a muscular youth
of probably eighteen years, though the serious
look about his eyes and mouth, and his dark
hair gave him a somewhat older appearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;It used to be the Eagle tavern, but it ain&rsquo;t
now. Is that all?&rdquo; the man in the doorway replied
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, it is not all,&rdquo; the lad returned.
&ldquo;There are two of us with a horse and wagon
and we want to stay all night. The storm is
growing worse, and though we had intended to
camp by the roadside, we pushed on through
the mud and darkness to reach this place. We
expect to pay for our lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make no difference, I tell ye! We
ain&rsquo;t keeping a public house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Mr. Tavern-keeper, my friend
and I have both been here before, and if we are
willing to stay, you should surely be willing to
keep us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; called the one who remained
in the wagon, &ldquo;and let&rsquo;s have a lantern
out here, and lose no further time about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the door moved aside to let the
light fall more directly on his caller&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I rec&rsquo;lect ye,&rdquo; he said slowly. And
then, his face brightening suddenly, he added
more pleasantly, &ldquo;Wait a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He closed the door and a murmur of voices
sounded for a short time from within. Presently,
however, the man reappeared with a tallow
candle set in a round tin box full of small
holes, which he carried by a ring in its top, as
a lantern, and followed the young men who had
summoned him, to the cart drawn up by the
roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eagle tavern&rsquo;s been closed all summer
and we hadn&rsquo;t ought to keep ye,&rdquo; the man explained,
standing by while the two boys unhitched
their horse and led the animal into the
log barn across the road from the house. &ldquo;Ye
kin pull yer cart under this shed out o&rsquo; the
rain,&rdquo; he went on, indicating a lean-to beside
the barn.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the horse had been fed and
the host led the way into the house, entering
a long, low room, where, in a fireplace, a
smoky, cheerless blaze was flickering. On a
table set against the wall opposite the fireplace,
a candle was burning, and toward the farther
end of the dingy apartment two men were
seated, their chairs tilted back in careless attitudes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t much here to eat,&rdquo; the landlord
said, as he motioned his guests to a settle
in the chimney corner. &ldquo;My wife died an&rsquo; I
quit keepin&rsquo; a tavern. I&rsquo;ll git ye what I kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys he thus ushered in did not sit
down, but stood before the blaze to allow their
clothes to dry; the one who had remained in
the wagon while the other went to the door,
turning about after a minute or two and stirring
the fire till it burned more brightly. He
was seventeen years old or thereabout, more
slender than his companion and not so tall. His
brown hair grew long, and about his blue eyes
there was a twinkle of merriment, as he said:
&ldquo;Wood is cheap; we may as well have enough
fire to do some good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, young man,&rdquo; spoke one of
the two strangers still sitting in the semi-darkness.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said the lad, still stirring
the fire, adopting the stranger&rsquo;s own words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>One of the two men arose and stepping up
to the blaze seated himself on the settle. He
was a villainous looking fellow, his curly black
hair cut short, his nose very large, red and
sharp pointed, his chin unnaturally prominent,
his eyes small, black, and deep-set, marks of
smallpox adding further to make his face an unpleasant
one. His age was not less than forty-five
years.</p>
<p>So disagreeable, indeed, did the two boys
find this man&rsquo;s appearance that instinctively
both looked more closely to see what his companion
was like. They beheld a man ten years
younger than the other, though his hair was
turning gray, and his hardened leather-like
skin made him seem older than he was. He had
fairly honest eyes, however, though he turned
them away and looked steadily in another direction
when he found that he was observed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was just tellin&rsquo; my friends here about
Ichabod Nesbit bein&rsquo; killed, when you chaps
come along,&rdquo; said the landlord a few minutes
later, as he came bringing in some cold meat
and a loaf of bread, which he placed on the
table. Then asking his young guests to sit
down and help themselves, which they proceeded
to do, he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rec&rsquo;lect that you boys was sort o&rsquo; interested
in Nesbit, an&rsquo; I heard that it was you two
that brought the news East of how he was
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the older of the two lads in a
disinterested way, while the other gave him a
quiet pinch under the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed by an Indian, you said, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
put in the villainous looking man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Injun named Black Eagle,&rdquo; said the
landlord.</p>
<p>Neither boy made any move to join in the
conversation and the tavern-keeper took another
tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most forgot how to be polite,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t rec&rsquo;lect your names, young men, but
make you acquainted with Mr. Samuel Duff
and Mr. Lon Dexter, travelers same as you be.
My name&rsquo;s Quilling, ye know that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>It was to the name Samuel Duff that the villainous
looking man answered. His better appearing
companion arose as the name Lon Dexter
was pronounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Kingdom,&rdquo; said the older of
the two boys, rising to shake hands as the men
came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine is Jerome,&rdquo; said the more slender
lad, with none too much friendship in his
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going West, I take it,&rdquo; said Duff, trying to
speak pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young man named Kingdom,
as both boys reseated themselves and
went on with their supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; he of the evil appearance continued&mdash;&ldquo;Dexter
and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great country&mdash;the Ohio country, I
mean,&rdquo; said Kingdom, his keen, dark eyes
scrutinizing the fellow who had seemed to suggest
that they might travel together, while he
mentally decided that he would like no such
arrangement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a great country and a big country.
We&rsquo;re just going to look around and see
whether there would be a good chance to get
hold of first-rate land to settle on when the Indian
troubles are over,&rdquo; Duff answered.</p>
<p>No immediate reply being made to his words,
the fellow went on in a careless tone which anyone
could have seen was assumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t catch us staying around long
where the Redskins have war paint on. That
man Ichabod Nesbit, we were speaking of,
would probably have been living yet if he
hadn&rsquo;t gone off to that blasted wilderness.
What part of the country was he killed in, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond Pittsburg. Why?&rdquo; quickly put in
the lad Jerome, his interest aroused. For the
thought came to him that Ichabod Nesbit was
just such an outlaw as the fellow now inquiring
about him looked to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! nothing in particular! You seem to
be mighty suspicious, the way you ask
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo;&rdquo; Duff exclaimed, with anger he tried
not to show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm ain&rsquo;t be&rsquo;n done, I don&rsquo;t see. Jest
hear it rain though!&rdquo; put in the other of the
two men, Dexter, speaking for almost the first
time. His voice was a hoarse whisper, and
gave the impression that he was frightened and
afraid to speak louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Kingdom, &ldquo;there is no secret
about when and how and where the man Nesbit
was killed. He had followed us all the way
from this very tavern, clear across the mountains
and the Ohio river. On the way West, he
fired at us one night, as we were in camp, and
happened to kill Northwind, the son of the Indian,
Black Eagle. The long and short of it
all is, that Black Eagle, after burying his son,
found the trail of Nesbit and followed it&mdash;tracked
him through woods and over mountains,
though how he could do it is wonderful,
and at last came up with him only a few minutes
after Nesbit had fired on our camp a second
time, killing our horse. They fought, and
Nesbit was killed, but just how or where we do
not know. We did not see the fight or know
anything about it until Black Eagle told it himself,
months afterward, and showed the man&rsquo;s
skull as certain evidence that he was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>For a little time nothing more was said. The
wind howled dolefully outside and the rain
beating on the roof and windows added to the
feeling of melancholy which seemed to pervade
the whole place. Little wonder is it that
the thoughts of the two boys went back to the
terrible experiences they had had in a former
trip from their home in Connecticut to the
wilderness beyond the western frontier of
Pennsylvania. They remembered how a robber
and cut-throat by occupation, Ichabod Nesbit,
had attempted to relieve them of their
money at this very inn&mdash;the Eagle tavern&mdash;how
they had shot at him and he had then secretly
followed them, mile after mile, week
after week, firing at them from a distance on
two occasions and at last killing their horse
when they were but a few miles from the spot
where, beside the Cuyahoga river, they located
and built a cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>They remembered, too, that Nesbit had been
in search of a cousin, named Arthur Bridges,
whom he would have killed had he found him,
in order to palm himself off as Bridges, whom
he closely resembled, and secure his property.
And Nesbit was responsible from the beginning
for Arthur Bridges&rsquo; never having returned
home after the Revolutionary war, in
which he was a soldier. They had met on the
road and Nesbit told Bridges that his
(Bridges&rsquo;) mother had died and his father was
cursing him and hoping never to see him again
because he had joined General Washington&rsquo;s
army. And it was only by chance that Bridges
had discovered through Tom Fish, a friend
who had gone in search of him, that Nesbit had
deceived him most cruelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian&mdash;did you say his name was
Black Eagle?&mdash;is quite civilized, I understand,&rdquo;
said Duff, at last. &ldquo;His home is in the
East.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;More civilized than some white folks,&rdquo;
spoke up young Jerome, remembering that the
Redskin had been kind to him and Kingdom.</p>
<p>Duff growled an inaudible reply, in response
to this thrust, and Kingdom, being tired and,
moreover, wishing to avoid any trouble with
this disagreeable fellow, suggested that it was
time to go to bed.</p>
<p>The landlord, upon request of the boys,
brought a candle and showed them into a small
down-stairs room opening into a narrow passageway
which led to the general living room
where they had passed the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had not stopped at this wretched
hole,&rdquo; said Jerome when the boys were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that. It is pleasanter
to be here, disagreeable as it is, than to
be camped along the road,&rdquo; Kingdom answered.
&ldquo;We could have slept in the wagon,
but the horse couldn&rsquo;t, and it is such a bad
night! Make the best of it, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>For an hour the young friends lay awake
talking of their journey and especially of the
unusual interest the two strangers had shown
in the death of Ichabod Nesbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have a drink of water,&rdquo; said Jerome,
as Kingdom turned over to go to sleep; and
slipping into his trousers he felt his way along
the passage, and opened the door of the living-room.
The landlord and Duff and Dexter were
sitting beside the little table, their heads bent
close to the candle, while they intently examined
a frayed and time-worn piece of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use, it ain&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve studied it
right side up an&rsquo; wrong side up an&rsquo; side ways
an&rsquo; length ways, an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t no use!&rdquo; Quilling,
the landlord, was saying when Jerome&rsquo;s
footfall attracted the attention of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast you, you blasted spy!&rdquo; cried Duff,
springing toward the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t repeat that, mister,&rdquo; was the lad&rsquo;s
cool answer. &ldquo;I was not spying on you, and
don&rsquo;t intend to let any one call me such names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was only jokin&rsquo;&mdash;only jokin&rsquo;,&rdquo; hoarsely
whispered Dexter, trying to laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TALL TODD&rsquo;S WARNING.</span></h2>
<p>Having gotten a drink of water, as he had
set out to do, Jerome quietly returned to his
room. He told Kingdom what had happened
and they wisely determined to sleep with one
eye open. This they did, their trained senses
ready to detect the first unusual sound, but
nothing occurred to disturb them, and even
Ring, their faithful dog, sleeping beside the
bed, showed no sign of uneasiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Duff and Mr. Dexter ain&rsquo;t up yet,&rdquo; the
landlord explained, as he set out a scanty
breakfast for the boys, when morning came.
But the young friends made no comment, and
though the man stood around hoping to hear
some expression from them as to what they
thought of the worthy pair of whom he spoke,
his curiosity was unsatisfied.</p>
<p>An almost perfect autumn day followed the
stormy night. The sky was flecked with clouds,
but between them the sun shone bright and
cheery and a soft, warm wind aided in drying
the muddy roads. The young emigrants,
safely on their way once more, were in the best
of spirits. They talked at length of the strange
actions of the men at the Eagle tavern, and although
they could reach no satisfactory conclusion
as to the meaning of the piece of frayed
paper the fellows had had, they attached not a
great deal of importance to it&mdash;far, very far,
less than it deserved, as they were destined in
time to learn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>A long journey lay before these two boys,
whom readers of &ldquo;Far Past the Frontier&rdquo; will
have recognized as Return Kingdom and John
Jerome, on their way once more to the wilderness
beyond Fort Pitt or Pittsburg. Six
months earlier they had left their little cabin
in the forests to return to their home in Connecticut.
In company with them was Big Pete
Ellis, whom they had rescued from the Indians,
he and Return having escaped together from a
band of Mingoes, who, headed by a Delaware
Indian, Big Buffalo, had attacked the boys&rsquo;
cabin and after a desperate fight captured
Kingdom. Also with the lads when they went
back to Connecticut, it will be remembered, was
Tom Fish, the woodsman whose friendship
they had formed on their first trip West, and
Arthur Bridges, Tom&rsquo;s friend, who was a
cousin of Nesbit, the outlaw. Bridges had suddenly
appeared one evening at the cabin, and
as it had been believed that he was dead, there
was great rejoicing. Gladly he had gone with
Tom Fish and Kingdom and Jerome to Connecticut
where for years his mother had been
living upon the hope that he would sometime
return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>It was in May that the boys and their friends
had gone from the savage country where they
had built their cabin; and now having worked
as harvest hands during the summer, they were
headed once more for the land of the Delawares,
their cart packed with a well selected
stock of supplies for their own use and a variety
of articles for trade with the Indians.</p>
<p>On their previous venture, when they had
first set out to make homes for themselves in
the new country, the two friends had done well
as traders; and though this time they meant to
give more attention to clearing land for farms,
they knew that the Indians would receive them
more kindly if they came with merchandise to
exchange for furs, while they would be quite
unwelcome if they came only as settlers. Such
at least, had been their former experience and,
notwithstanding the trouble they had had with
the Mingoes and Big Buffalo, they hoped to
have no further difficulty, as Hopocon, or Captain
Pipe, as the white men called him, the
chief of the Delawares, had promised his protection
when they had paid him for the land on
which they built their cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Indeed, they were certain that Big Buffalo
would not have dared lead the Mingoes against
their cabin, had it not been that Captain Pipe
and most of his warriors had gone to the far
northwest for fighting which was expected to
take place there.</p>
<p>From Connecticut to Ohio in these days is
not a very long journey. It was different in
the year 1791 when Return Kingdom and John
Jerome were making the trip over rough roads,
through the forests and an almost unbroken
wilderness, constantly growing wilder, as they
progressed, and the way more dangerous, especially
after passing Pittsburg. Steadily,
however, they continued on. The weather was
for the most part pleasant, and though the
evenings were cool, blazing camp fires gave all
the warmth desired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Only one night after leaving the Eagle tavern
did the boys spend under roof, for there
were few inns along the way and as the borders
of civilization were left farther and farther behind,
none whatever. No adventure of importance
befell them, however, until they reached
Pittsburg, then a rough frontier hamlet built
up about the fort from which it took its name.
They had learned the road on their previous
journey, and though a number of mishaps had
occurred, including a hard fall John had had
from a great rock he climbed in hope of getting
a shot at a bear which had trotted across
the rough trail some distance ahead of them,
none of these were serious.</p>
<p>And thus, in the late afternoon of a hazy October
day the young men drove slowly into the
frontier settlement which would be the last
sign of civilization they expected to see for a
long time to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It might be years before they would return
to Connecticut again. Return Kingdom, being
an orphan, who had known no home except as
the bound boy of Henry Catesby, had few near
friends there. Mrs. Catesby and her daughter,
Mary, had been very kind to him after Mr.
Catesby&rsquo;s death, but they were now living in
town that Mary might attend school. Captain
William Bowen, an old friend, was the only
other person, unless it was Pete Ellis, who
cared much about him, he thought. Why
should he wish to return? There was only one
other tie to bind him to Bruceville, his boyhood
home. His mother&rsquo;s grave was in the little
churchyard there. She had been dead a long
time, but he loved her memory. His father,
killed in the Revolutionary war, he had never
known.</p>
<p>As for John Jerome, he was one of a large
family. His father was poor. Their little
farm would scarcely support them all and
work was scarce. That he would be missed
John knew, but he also knew that his chances
of getting along&mdash;of making something of himself&mdash;were
better in the newer country. He
would go home some day to visit, surely, but he
had set out to make his own way, and it might
be years before the opportunity again to see
those he loved, would come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Maybe both boys were thinking of the
friends left behind, as very soberly they drove
into Pittsburg. Their heavy, covered wagon
drawn by one strong horse attracted no little
attention as they passed down the main street
of the rough, stockaded town of brick and log
buildings, and with the easy familiarity of the
early times many called out to them in a
friendly, hospitable way to ask whence they
came and whither they were going. There
were words of astonishment, and grave shaking
of heads when the travelers answered that
they were bound for the unbroken West. Said
one man in a worn-out soldier&rsquo;s uniform:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safe enough if you go down the
river with some big party, but you&rsquo;ll be scalped,
sure, if you go toward Sandusky Plains, as you
say. Why, there&rsquo;s terrible times! General St.
Clair left Fort Washington not six weeks ago
to march into that country and there&rsquo;ll be
murderin&rsquo; an&rsquo; scalpin&rsquo; to beat all get out! St.
Clair was here in the spring, an&rsquo; all summer
long he has been recruitin&rsquo; at Fort Washington
for the biggest kind of fightin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
bound to come just as soon as he gets into the
Redskins&rsquo; country. He&rsquo;s got two boys o&rsquo; mine
with him&mdash;young fellers &rsquo;bout same age as you,
but I ain&rsquo;t worried half like I would be if they
was goin&rsquo; off by themselves, not a hundred
miles west o&rsquo; here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>As the boys drove up to the public house
where they had stopped on their former trip
to the West, they were recognized by a number
of men seated on a split log bench just outside,
smoking their pipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder an&rsquo; lightnin&rsquo;! Where ye goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
exclaimed one of the loafers, a great, lanky fellow
known as Tall Todd, as Kingdom and Jerome,
rather enjoying the excitement their appearance
caused, stepped up to shake hands
with their acquaintances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; back to yer cabin beyond old Fort
Laurens? By jinks, ye ain&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s sartin
death to both of ye. Wasn&rsquo;t ye both purty near
murdered an&rsquo; one of ye purty near burned to
the stake? D&rsquo;ye s&rsquo;pose them Mingoes will hev
forgot that ye killed three or four of the war
party at yer cabin? D&rsquo;ye s&rsquo;pose that Big Buffalo
devil will hev forgot his grudge ag&rsquo;in ye?
By jinks! a Redskin don&rsquo;t never fergit these
things! Fellers, we had all orter be hung fer
murder if we let these young shavers throw
their lives away, this here way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vehemence with which Todd spoke, refusing
to be interrupted, though both Kingdom
and Jerome tried to break in on his exclamations,
caused the boys some uneasiness; not
so much for fear of their safety beyond the
border, as for the possibility that their friends
would be unpleasantly insistent that they must
abandon their trip. They realized that their
undertaking was hazardous, but they relied on
their ability to make peace with the Indians as
they had done before, and they were certain
that if Captain Pipe, the Delaware Chieftain,
were in his village, a few miles from which
their cabin stood, Big Buffalo would not dare
attack them again. When their horse had been
led away to the stable, and all were seated before
the door of the house which did duty as
tavern, the young men explained these things
to Tall Todd and the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was Tom Fish an&rsquo; Bridges doin&rsquo; that
they let ye come &rsquo;way off here by yerselves?&rdquo;
suddenly asked Todd, who had been shutting
his eyes and mouth tight, and shaking his head
most emphatically, in answer to everything the
boys had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they said to wait until winter and they
would come with us. But we did not agree to
that, and as they lived so far away, we did not
see them again. It was in July that we saw
them last. When we got ready, we started. If
they had come it would have been only for a
little hunting, and we were afraid they would
think they were obliged to go with us, if we
sent them word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was only last week that a white man was
found dead and scalped just beyond old Fort
McIntosh,&rdquo; said an elderly man, quietly.
&ldquo;About a month ago a chap named Keaton was
tomahawked and his scalp taken, not a day&rsquo;s
march from this very spot. Both were killed
in a mysterious way, too&mdash;one shot from ambush,
the other attacked while he was cooking
himself a meal; and he never knew what hit
him, from all appearances, they say. It looks
mighty bad. I&rsquo;ve been through the woods a
good many times, and I don&rsquo;t get scared at my
shadow, but honest to goodness I mean it,
when I say that I wouldn&rsquo;t care to go a great
ways into the Ohio country alone, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jinks, it is queer how them two fellers
was killed, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; put in Tall Todd. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
it jest reminds me o&rsquo; ol&rsquo; man Crane that was
killed the same way four days after he left here
for the Moravian settlement. Nobody knew
how, nor nothin&rsquo;. Ye remember some fellers
comin&rsquo; up river picked up his carcass. Not a
thing he had was touched. Only his bullets an&rsquo;
powder was gone&mdash;an&rsquo; his hair. His gun an&rsquo;
knife&mdash;everything else was layin&rsquo; jest as he
fell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who did it?&rdquo; demanded John Jerome,
quite abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest it! Who did it?&rdquo; Todd answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a story told,&rdquo; said the quiet, elderly
man, &ldquo;that a Redskin who got away at
the time of the massacre of the Christian Indians
at the Moravian settlement, ten years
ago, come next March, has lately come back to
these parts and kills every white man he sees,
on sight. A couple of hunters and traders coming
in here from Kentucky told the tale. We
don&rsquo;t know how true it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; of it, I&rsquo;ll bet a gun,&rdquo;
said Todd. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the yarn, an&rsquo; it don&rsquo;t
stand to reason. &rsquo;Cause as you jest said, Eli,
the Moravians was killed ten years ago, come
March, an&rsquo; that score was all settled when
Crawford was burned. An&rsquo; right there,
youngsters, is somethin&rsquo; to put in yer nightcaps,
when yer countin&rsquo; on the friendship of
that ornery Delaware, Captain Pipe, by jinks!
He was one of the critters that burnt Colonel
Crawford!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we knew that before we ever met him,&rdquo;
said Kingdom cheerfully, lest his friend Jerome
should be depressed by these alarming
reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only started out to say that the killin&rsquo; of
the Moravians was so long ago, that it ain&rsquo;t
likely any Injun has just now started out to
hunt scalps and satisfaction on account of it,&rdquo;
Todd replied, somewhat taken back by the
young traveler&rsquo;s cheery reply to his doleful
warning against Captain Pipe.</p>
<p>The sun had gone down as the men and boys
were talking and now the guests at the place
were called to supper. Only one of those who
were sitting outside arose and went in with the
boys. The others, being there only as loungers,
remained where they were or went to supper
elsewhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The man who accompanied Kingdom and
Jerome to the table had little to say, but ate of
the roast venison and corn bread which was
placed before them, silently. He was a genteel
appearing person, of about sixty years, wearing
a wig and a riding suit of fine texture. His
smoothly shaven face bore marks of refinement
though there was a certain look of dissipation
about him. He had not spoken outside and the
two boys had not learned his name or business,
though they knew from his sombre dress that
he was a Quaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Ree, the stories of those chaps
being killed so mysteriously bothers me more
than anything else,&rdquo; said John Jerome to his
friend. &ldquo;Honestly, I would think Ichabod Nesbit
was still alive, shooting at people from behind,
and all that, if I didn&rsquo;t know positively
that Black Eagle killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger at the opposite side of the table
gave a sudden start,&mdash;a start as if an unseen
hand had struck him on the back, as the name
of Nesbit was mentioned. He cast a quick, intent
look toward the two young friends, and
perceiving that his agitation had been noticed,
put his hand before his mouth and coughed violently,
plainly trying to make believe that
some obstruction of his throat caused his sudden
disturbance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A MYSTERY OF THE FOREST.</span></h2>
<p>Much as Kingdom and Jerome wondered
what interest this well dressed stranger had in
Ichabod Nesbit, they were too polite to ask any
questions, unless they were first spoken to; but
their thoughts turned naturally to the frayed
and old piece of writing which John had seen
in the possession of the men at the Eagle tavern.
They recalled how interested those men
had been in learning just where Ichabod Nesbit
was killed, and that Duff and Dexter had
said they were on their way West.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Yet, much as they tried, neither of the boys
could suggest a reason for the interest in the
death of the dead robber which seemed to have
so suddenly risen. They discussed the subject
at much length, sitting alone in the moonlight
that evening, on the heavy shafts of their
wagon, beside the barn, when they had seen to
it that their horse was fed and their dog had a
comfortable place for the night on a blanket
beneath the cart, insuring the perfect safety of
the vehicle and its contents.</p>
<p>The lads had not seen Tall Todd after supper,
but as they were going into the house to
go to bed, he met them near the door and urged
them most seriously to give up their plan to
go on into the wilderness alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Todd was a good natured, kindly man and
undoubtedly meant well by his friends, but by
habit he spoke in an extravagant manner, and
the young men believed that many of the
alarming statements he made were exaggerated&mdash;either
by himself, quite unintentionally,
owing to his manner of speaking, or by those
from whom he had heard them. They thought
most seriously, however, of the report given by
the quiet, elderly man, Eli Hopp, concerning
the mysterious murders which had taken place
along the extreme frontier, and prudence bade
them investigate before venturing into the almost
trackless forest alone. They probably
would have remained in Pittsburg several days
or more for this purpose, but for a remark
made by the proprietor of the public house at
which they remained over night, next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tall Todd says you chaps have decided to
stay here awhile and maybe wait for some
party goin&rsquo; down river, to go along with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words fired Kingdom&rsquo;s pride. He was
usually a cool, thoughtful lad; and though he
showed no resentment or injured self-esteem
in his tones, now, he answered instantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he must be mistaken. We not only did
not say that, but we are leaving to-day to go
on to the cabin we built on the Cuyahoga
river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have corn and other crops to harvest,
if there is anything left of them. We had quite
a farm, you know, when we left there last
spring,&rdquo; put in John Jerome jocularly.</p>
<p>The landlord&rsquo;s face grew serious and he began
telling of the Indian disturbances all along
the border; but Kingdom adroitly turned the
conversation in such a way that he was able
without seeming over-curious, to inquire about
the well dressed stranger who had sat at table
with them the night before and had been so disturbed
by mention of the name of Ichabod
Nesbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By vum, partner, you&rsquo;ve stumped me,&rdquo; the
man replied. &ldquo;That fellow came along here on
horseback day before yesterday, engaged his
keep, carried his saddle bags to a little room I
let him have, as though they was both full of
gold&mdash;he watched them that close&mdash;and this
morning he paid his reckoning, got on his horse
and away he went, saddle bags and all. Tall
Todd couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of him, so I
knew &rsquo;twan&rsquo;t any use my tryin&rsquo;, though he did
tell me what he didn&rsquo;t tell Todd, and that was,
that his name was Theodore Hatch and that he
was a surveyor. But bless you! I don&rsquo;t believe
that. I think he&rsquo;s a British spy, that&rsquo;s
what I think!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty dangerous for him to be around
here, if he is,&rdquo; said young Jerome, bristling up
as though he would personally assault the gentleman
the next time they met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woods are full of British from Detroit,&rdquo;
the landlord went on. &ldquo;Talk about the
war being over, what are the pestiferous Red-coats
always setting the Indians against our
settlers so, for? We will have to set about
licking them out of their boots again, the way
they are behaving! But what most of all
makes me think this Mr. Theodore Hatch is a
Britisher is that he rode off down the river
right toward bad Injun country alone. He
wouldn&rsquo;t dare do it, if he wasn&rsquo;t a Britisher
and friendly with the Redskins. And what did
he have in them saddle bags, do you suppose?
He had gold for the Mingoes and the Delawares
and the Wyandots and every red mother&rsquo;s
son of the savages, he had. Now that&rsquo;s
what I think!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The two boys did not mention the stranger&rsquo;s
agitation of the night before, but they could not
understand how a British spy could have any
interest in Ichabod Nesbit, and as they talked
the subject over by themselves, they concluded
that on that point the landlord was probably
mistaken.</p>
<p>It was true, nevertheless, that then and for
many years afterward there were agents of the
British government going among the Indians,
rousing them to deeds of violence against the
American settlers. British soldiers helped in
the defeat of General St. Clair by the Indians
that very fall of 1791,&mdash;only a month later
than that day when Kingdom and Jerome,
some time after their talk with the landlord,
said goodbye to him and to Tall Todd and
others they knew, and set forth again upon
their journey on into the western wilds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Todd was still loud in his declarations that
it was nothing less than murder to permit the
boys to continue into the wilderness, but their
determination overbalanced all his objections
and, though cautioning them repeatedly, other
men really admired their pluck, as they
watched the two friends drive slowly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will reach the Cuyahoga river within
two weeks if we have good luck, Ree,&rdquo; said
John. &ldquo;That will give us all the time we need
to get our corn harvested, if there is any of it
left, and to get our little house all in good shape
for winter before cold weather comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we will be able to gather some nuts,
there are plenty of hickory-nuts and butternuts,
too, along the river and back among the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So with the most hopeful conversation the
boys passed the time. Had they fully realized
the dangers which would surround them they
could not have been so care-free. They knew
that they must keep their wits about them and
their eyes open wide, and this they did; but they
were far from expecting the adventures which
were in store for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The roads east of Pittsburg had been
scarcely worthy of the name, but west of that
frontier settlement there were practically none.
Neb&mdash;short for Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;the big black
horse the lads drove, had all he could do in
many instances to pull the well loaded cart up
the little hills which were encountered, and
through the swampy places which must now
and then be crossed. The trail followed was
the same as that taken by the boys upon their
previous journey West, the preceding fall, and
the work done at that time in opening a roadway
where it was impossible otherwise for the
cart to pass, stood them in good stead now.
But at best their progress was slow, and
Colonel Boquet, whose famous Indian expedition
many years earlier, traveled in part the
same course as that these two sons of Connecticut
were now taking, moved as fast as they did,
though he made but from seven to ten miles
a day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>For several miles, soon after leaving Pittsburg,
the trail the boys followed kept them
close to the Ohio river. There they discovered
the tracks of a horse which had preceded them.
Rightly they guessed that the hoof prints were
those of the steed of the mysterious stranger
who had called himself Theodore Hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could overtake him,&rdquo; said John,
speaking of the tracks they saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange that he should be going into
this country alone and with practically no baggage,&rdquo;
said Kingdom. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out what
he&rsquo;s up to, unless it be true that he is a British
agent. Of course it might be that he is a missionary
going to the Moravian villages, but he
did not look much like one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not. He looked like a soldier,
I thought&mdash;an army officer dressed up as a
Quaker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The prospect that the boys might fall in with
the mysterious stranger seemed to increase
daily. Though he undoubtedly traveled faster
than they, it was apparent that he was pursuing
the same general course as themselves and
much the same trail. They saw places where
he had encamped for the night, and often during
the day the tracks of his horse. Still there
was nothing to indicate the man&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon of the sixth day
after leaving Pittsburg. The young travelers
had found level land and comparatively easy
traveling that day, and having gone a long distance,
were casting about for a camping place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forge ahead and see if there is running
water in the little valley yonder,&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;If there is, we need go no further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastening forward, he came to the edge of
the hill sloping down to the shallow gully of
which he had spoken. He heard the trickle and
splash of a stream of water, and in another
moment would have turned to go back, but his
quick eye caught the outlines of a horse&rsquo;s
flank among some low bushes near the brook,
and he paused.</p>
<p>Carefully he watched but the animal did not
stir. Ree was not more than a hundred yards
away, and hurrying to him, John told of the
discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must be our Britisher,&rdquo; said Kingdom,
thoughtfully, &ldquo;so few of the Indians have
horses. But we will soon find out. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving their cart where it was, for Neb
could be trusted not to run away, the boys
walked with as great a show of unconcern as
possible down into the valley. They took pains
to speak to each other in tones moderately
loud, as though they were looking only for a
place to camp, hoping to attract the stranger&rsquo;s
attention. But their approach seemed entirely
unnoticed. They could see only the flanks and
back of the horse which was standing among
the low bushes, and were somewhat surprised
to notice that the animal was saddled. So perfectly
still did the creature stand, too, they
were puzzled more and more.</p>
<p>Suddenly the horse raised its head, looked
backward with great, sorrowful eyes for a moment,
then with a low, pitiful whinny turned
and trotted toward the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong here,&rdquo; said Kingdom,
beneath his breath. &ldquo;My goodness, I hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The sentence was cut short by John speaking
to the dapple gray that had now come close up
to them, plainly doing its best to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show us what it is&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter, old
fellow?&rdquo; said Jerome, patting the horse&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>Kingdom did not wait for an answer to his
companion&rsquo;s question, but stepped quickly forward
among the underbrush. He pushed his
way through to a small, clear space beside the
stream, and as he reached it a little cry of surprise
and dismay escaped him. Then swift as
a deer he leaped to the center of the open
space, and in another instant was kneeling beside
the body of&mdash;Theodore Hatch, the Quaker.</p>
<p>The man lay face upward upon the leafy
ground, the pallor of death upon his cheeks, the
scalp cut from his head. Beside his body the
ground was ploughed deep by the hoofs of the
horse, showing clearly how the faithful beast
had watched and waited for a word from the
master who could not speak. A few feet distant
were the dead ashes of a tiny fire, and a
small coffee dipper burned black still setting
among them, its contents long since evaporated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Jerome could say no more as, followed
by their faithful dog and the stranger&rsquo;s horse,
he hastened through the brush to his friend&rsquo;s
side and at a glance saw what was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive&mdash;sure as the world, the body is
still almost warm!&rdquo; cried Ree in an undertone,
and seizing the blackened dipper, filled it at the
brook and bathed the stranger&rsquo;s death-like
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if there is brandy or anything in his
saddle bags, John,&rdquo; he next commanded. &ldquo;Oh,
if we can save him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of taking the chance of finding
nothing to the purpose among the stranger&rsquo;s
baggage, John dashed away across the valley
and up the hill to their cart. He knew there
were restoratives in a small medicine chest
they carried beneath the seat of that vehicle,
and in a minute or two he had selected what he
wanted and returned. He found that Ree had
loosened the stranger&rsquo;s collar and placed his
own coat beneath his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the wound, Ree?&rdquo; he asked in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t looked,&rdquo; Kingdom answered,
drawing open the stranger&rsquo;s mouth and putting
between his lips a tiny quantity of the
stimulant Jerome had brought. &ldquo;Help rub his
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As both boys pressed and chafed the stricken
man&rsquo;s fingers, palms and wrists, they felt a
feeble warmth in them&mdash;so feeble, indeed, that
they feared their task was hopeless. But they
worked on and on, again administering a portion
of the stimulant. At the end of twenty
minutes they could see that freer circulation of
blood had been established and were hopeful.</p>
<p>A very little later the stranger&rsquo;s eyelids
fluttered and opened. His horse, which had
watched, with almost human intelligence, everything
that had been done, gave a soft, low
whinny of gladness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LONE INDIAN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Ph&oelig;be,&rdquo; murmured the stranger
in a dazed, uncertain way, recognizing the
voice of his faithful mare, but not realizing
where he was. &ldquo;Sweet Ph&oelig;be,&rdquo; he whispered
again, his eyes closing dreamily as the horse
answered to his words with a delighted little
neigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of his head,&rdquo; whispered John Jerome
in tones of sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have lain here since last evening,
at least,&rdquo; Ree answered, &ldquo;and his horse has not
moved from the spot. He had probably ridden
up here to camp for the night and had not even
unsaddled his mare when he was shot. We must
keep our eyes wide open, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is just such another sneaking murder as
they told about at Pittsburg, Ree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go back and bring up the cart, John.
We may as well camp right here. It is the safest
spot we can find, according to the old saying
that &lsquo;lightning doesn&rsquo;t strike twice in the
same place.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>John hurried away to carry out this suggestion,
while Kingdom prepared to build a small
fire, taking the precaution to dig a hole in the
earth for that purpose, and covering this nearly
over with strips of green bark that the flame
would be concealed and not bring the Indians
down upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>In a short time John returned with Neb and
the wagon and with blankets and fur robes a
comfortable bed for the wounded stranger was
soon made. While one lad prepared supper,
then, the other unharnessed and unsaddled
their own and the Quaker&rsquo;s horse and tethered
them by short ropes where they might drink or
graze along the bank of the stream. It was apparent
that the dapple gray had eaten nothing
during the long watch over its wounded master
for now the animal drank and ate most
greedily.</p>
<p>A sort of broth, not unlike beef tea, was prepared
from venison for the sick man and
though the boys persuaded him to swallow
some of it, he was still delirious and knew
nothing of where he was or what had happened.</p>
<p>A more thorough examination of the stranger&rsquo;s
condition revealed the fact that he had
been shot through the left side, just over the
heart, and either in falling or from the butt of
a rifle or some similar instrument had received
an ugly wound on his head, just back of his
right ear. These injuries, added to the fact that
his scalp had been carried off, made it quite
miraculous that he was still alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have heard of men living after having
been scalped,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad business; but we must pull him
through,&rdquo; Kingdom replied with determination.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch him and the camp till midnight
or after. You get some sleep, John,
while you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jerome had fully expected, though he
knew it was useless to remonstrate, Ree did not
call him until almost daylight. Getting up, he
hitched up Neb and saddled the stranger&rsquo;s
horse, which came up to him with perfect gentleness
when he called &ldquo;Ph&oelig;be,&rdquo; the name he
had heard the master use. A little later he
broiled some venison steaks, and then called
Ree to breakfast.</p>
<p>Theodore Hatch, if such was the stranger&rsquo;s
name, though the boys doubted it, had been
very restless during the night. Often in his
delirium he had spoken of a letter and twice
had mentioned the name of Ichabod Nesbit.
How so gentlemanly appearing a man could be
connected with the dead robber was more than
the boys could guess, though they now considered
it certain that he, as well as the precious
pair of rogues they had met at the Eagle tavern,
had some mysterious interest in the man
whom the Indian, Black Eagle, had killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>As the stranger was still unconscious Ree
and John had no fear of giving offense as they
spoke of these things in his presence. Indeed,
he had not the least understanding of what was
taking place around him.</p>
<p>How to continue their journey, carrying the
sick man with them, was considerable of a
problem for the young travelers, as their cart
was already heavily loaded; but they solved
the difficulty by making a pack-horse of the
stranger&rsquo;s mare, thus providing room under
the canvas of their covered wagon to prepare a
bed for the injured stranger. They raised him
up and placed him upon the blankets with
much effort but successfully, and before the sun
was an hour high, were once more on their
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Fifty miles ahead of them was the lonely
cabin by the Cuyahoga river. A somewhat
greater distance on the backward trail was
Pittsburg. To the south and west almost an
equal distance was the only other semblance of
civilization in all the surrounding wilderness&mdash;the
missionary settlement of the Moravians.</p>
<p>Whether to take the wounded man to the latter
place or back to Pittsburg or straight on to
the cabin was a question the boys discussed at
some length. The result was their decision to
push on toward the Cuyahoga, and before
nightfall they had traveled a good twelve miles.
They saw no sign of an enemy during the day
or the night which followed. The stranger
continued insensible of all that was taking
place, though he called out frequently, often
speaking to his horse, his tones showing the
deepest love for the animal. And the mare,
pricking up her ears at every sound of her
master&rsquo;s voice, exhibited for him an attachment
far beyond anything of the kind the boys had
ever seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>It may have been this very love the unhappy
animal had for its stricken master which resulted
in the mare&rsquo;s giving the alarm when the
two boys had almost forgotten the dangers
constantly surrounding them. For suddenly,
as the sun was going down in the afternoon of
the second day after the discovery of the unconscious
form of Theodore Hatch, when preparations
were being made to camp in a convenient
gully, the horse sniffed the air and
snorted and neighed violently.</p>
<p>Quick to realize that something was wrong,
Kingdom leaped for his rifle, and had no more
than secured the weapon when a bullet shrieked
close to his shoulder and buried itself in a tree
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, John!&rdquo; Ree called, but not heeding
the command, Jerome, who had gone a few rods
away for water, sped forward to the camp before
seeking shelter behind a tree trunk.</p>
<p>Vigilantly both boys watched for a sight of
the would-be assassin. They could see nothing
but a streak of smoke curling up in the direction
from which the shot had been fired. Several
minutes passed, and though no sound of
footsteps was heard, there came just as suddenly
as before, from another direction, the
crack of a rifle and a bullet speeding so near
John Jerome&rsquo;s head that he dropped flat on the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we were surrounded,&rdquo; said
Kingdom coolly, as John called out that he was
not hurt.</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s dapple gray was trembling
with fear, though Neb, the cart horse, was not
in the least disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than just a different degree
of intelligence to cause that,&rdquo; whispered Kingdom,
crouching behind a tree and cautiously
peering out, John having called attention to
the behavior of the horses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture to
say that the Redskins around us now are the
same that scalped the stranger, and the horse
knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No further sign of the attacking party was
seen. What had become of the foe or foes
neither Ree nor John could guess, and though,
when the twilight had given way to dense darkness,
they took turn about in making a half
dozen scouting expeditions to learn if possible
where the enemy was, and what might be expected
from that source, no trace of savage or
savages could be discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Puzzled as they were, neither boy lay down
to sleep that night, nor did they build a fire,
whose light might make them easy targets.</p>
<p>While it was still dark Neb was hitched up,
the still unconscious stranger in the cart made
as comfortable as possible, and with the first
light of the dawn of another day, the young
emigrants were pushing on farther and deeper
into the wilds, undaunted by the night&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>All possible care was taken to guard against
surprise, however, and with much coaxing and
petting and painstaking instruction Ring, the
big, yellow half-mastiff, was taught to give up
the place he liked best, close beside Neb, for
which horse he showed a deep friendship, and
follow along a hundred yards or so in the rear.
Ree went ahead an equal distance, except
when it was necessary to help John clear the
way of trees or logs for the cart to pass, and
John himself kept a sharp lookout on either
side, while driving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>So the day passed and nothing occurred further
to alarm the two boys or retard their advance.
But they reminded one another that
they must not relax their watchfulness.</p>
<p>They hoped and fully believed that when
they reached the country about their cabin&mdash;with
all the woods near which they were well
acquainted, their trouble would be at an end.
If Captain Pipe, the Delaware chief, were in
his village, he would permit no attack to be
made upon them by Big Buffalo or any other
of his tribe, and there would be only the wandering
Mingoes to fear. Some of these and
many others the lads had traded with and knew
personally. A few presents would renew their
friendship, and all would be well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Until the cabin was reached, however, there
were many dangers to be reckoned with, and
these were increased by the fact that they were
trying to save the life of the, to them, almost
unknown man, who might have enemies they
knew not of, and who could not help them one
bit, while positively delaying their progress by
adding to their load and the care with which
they must travel, on his account.</p>
<p>Camp was made, the evening following the
mysterious attack, in the center of a considerable
open space, nearly bare of trees, which
may have been at one time an Indian corn field.
The horses were picketed close to the wagon
and a defense of brush and small logs was built
to a height of a few feet all about the cart. The
wagon&rsquo;s contents were then so arranged that
the wounded man, who, though still delirious,
seemed to be gaining in strength, was protected
from stray bullets by boxes and other articles
piled at either side of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems actually foolish to go to all this
trouble,&rdquo; was Ree Kingdom&rsquo;s comment as he
surveyed the completed task.</p>
<p>Bang!&mdash;pr-r-r-r-s-s-st! A bullet whizzed
through the low breast-works and flattened itself
on the iron tire of the cart, close to John&rsquo;s
left elbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There he goes!&rdquo; cried young Jerome,
and leveled his rifle at an Indian who
leaped from tree to tree with most astonishing
speed, traveling in a circle about the camp at
a distance of eighty or ninety yards, loading
his rifle as he ran, with the greatest dexterity.</p>
<p>In another moment, as he thought the chance
was favorable, John fired. A second later
Kingdom also let drive, but all to no purpose,
for the next second there came from the side
of the camp opposite that from which the first
bullet had flown, another to keep it company,
splitting a spoke in one of the cart&rsquo;s wheels.</p>
<p>No sooner had he fired this second time than
the Indian disappeared in the depths of the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land o&rsquo; Goshen! What does the Redskin
mean?&rdquo; exclaimed John, as both boys saw him
fleeing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the same fellow that fired at us last
night. Look how nervous this poor mare is.
That proves it if nothing else does,&rdquo; answered
Kingdom, boldly rising from behind the brush-work
defenses, and patting the terror-stricken
horse of the stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;And did you see him run?&rdquo; John added.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard people talk of horses going like a
streak of lightning, but I never saw anything
on legs get over the ground the way that buck
did. I wonder, now, how long he intends keeping
up this game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Ree could answer the voice of Theodore
Hatch was heard loudly calling, &ldquo;Nay,
do not shoot! Thou art my friend. Hast thou
the letter, Ichabod&mdash;Ichabod Nesbit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were the most connected and intelligible
words the stranger had uttered, though
often in his unconsciousness he had called out,
but usually in a disconnected, incomprehensible
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ichabod, dost thou not know me? Thou art
not dead, Ichabod! Ah, I was deceived. They
told me thou wert killed by an Indian in the
forest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The boys looked questioningly one to the
other. Their thoughts ran back to the frayed
letter the men at the Eagle tavern had had, and
back farther still to the death of Ichabod Nesbit
at the hands of Black Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he is better,&rdquo; said Kingdom, referring
to the stranger. &ldquo;His brain is clearer,
though he doesn&rsquo;t know anything. I&rsquo;ll fix him
up some fresh medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By turns the two boys slept and watched the
long night through. As before, the mysterious
enemy gave no further trouble after twice firing
upon the camp, and another day came and
passed without incident.</p>
<p>Fearful of a repetition of the attack of the two
preceding evenings, the young travelers made
camp early this day that they might make a
more secure defense than before, ere nightfall.
This work they completed to their satisfaction
while the sun was still shining.</p>
<p>The rise of ground on which they had halted
gave them an advantage over their foe which
they had not had before. Impatiently they
watched and waited for the expected appearance
of the lone savage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;The third time&rsquo;s the charm, they say,&rdquo; remarked
John, with an uneasy little laugh. &ldquo;I
believe we will get him or he will get us, this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingdom did not answer, and the minutes
slipped slowly by. The sun was just disappearing
from view, like an immense ball of red
among the western trees, when the Indian
came.</p>
<p>Both boys caught sight of him at the same
moment, standing on a hill-top across a rugged
little valley from themselves, quietly surveying
them. As he was between them and the fading
light, they saw his face, painted a bright red,
and his buckskin clad figure most distinctly;
and both were certain that a belt which hung
loose about his waist was adorned with human
scalps.</p>
<p>For several seconds the young savage stood
gazing vacantly toward the lads. Then he saw
that he was observed. Quick as magic, and as
mysteriously, he disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HIDDEN TREASURE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He will not come back tonight,&rdquo; was Ree&rsquo;s
quiet comment, when the savage vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns, but he&rsquo;s swift!&rdquo; exclaimed
John, more excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows we are expecting him, and we
will have no trouble to-night,&rdquo; said Ree, and
time proved that he was right.</p>
<p>Early next morning the boys did have visitors,
however. Two strange Indians strode up
to their camp as they were preparing to move.
They were the first the young men had seen in
the wilderness, but they appeared friendly and
remained and talked for some time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The boys learned from the savages that
nearly all the Redmen of the country had gone
off to the northwest to join with the Delawares
and others already there, in fighting which was
expected. The Indians had kept a careful watch
on the movements of General St. Clair and his
troops, who, even then, were marching into
the territory which now comprises northwestern
Ohio, and a battle was looked for at any
time.</p>
<p>These two Indians did not know, however, or
declined to say, whether Big Buffalo, who had
made the boys so much trouble on their first
trip into the wilderness, had gone to join Captain
Pipe and the other Delaware warriors.
They likewise professed ignorance when John,
in language not exactly diplomatic, demanded
to know who the young Indian, who had twice
fired upon them was. Shrugging their shoulders,
the savages showed a desire to talk about
other things, and both Ree and John were convinced
that the fellows knew more than they
cared to acknowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>For friendship&rsquo;s sake the young pioneers gave
each of the savages a small present as they separated,
and the latter promised to send other
Indians whom they met to trade with the young
men as the hunting season progressed. However,
as so many of the Redmen had gone off
to the expected scene of war, the boys realized
at once that their work as traders would not
be so profitable as it had been the previous winter;
but, on the other hand, they would, on that
account, have more time for hunting and trapping,
themselves, and could also work with less
frequent interruptions in the many tasks necessary
to the improvement of the land for
which they had paid Captain Pipe.</p>
<p>The wounded stranger had become more and
more restless during the journey of this day,
but not once did he come to his senses. Ree
and John gave him the best care they could
and at the same time made all haste possible,
believing that if they could but reach their
cabin and place the sick man on a fairly comfortable
bed, they could save his life. Nevertheless
it was necessary to make camp some
time before sundown to be on their guard
against the return of the supposed assailant of
the stranger, and this they did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>But the wily savage did not appear. Perhaps
he knew that he would be expected; perhaps
the journey of the boys was taking him
too far from his accustomed haunts to pursue
them farther. The lads did not attempt to decide
the question, but remained ever closely on
their guard, and kept Ring, their dog, on duty
as a special scout on both flanks and front and
rear, most of the time, while they worked their
way steadily forward.</p>
<p>Ring&rsquo;s scouting, though not so intelligent as
that of a human being, of course, was very
helpful to his masters; but most of all, it resulted
in the making of a discovery which had
a most important bearing upon the future and
added a great deal indeed to the adventures
which were in store for the two friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was not far from here that Ichabod Nesbit
fired at us, killing our horse, last fall,&rdquo; said
John one evening as the boys were making
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be somewhere near the spot.
Very likely we shall pass it tomorrow,&rdquo; Ree
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not over a mile from here,&rdquo; John insisted.
&ldquo;When Nesbit shot at us and ran back,
Tom Fish and I followed after him, you remember,
never thinking that Black Eagle was
chasing him. I recollect noticing at the time
that oak tree with the bark torn off by lightning
over there. Why, it couldn&rsquo;t have been
very far from here that Black Eagle caught
Nesbit and killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Ree had climbed into the cart to give the still
unconscious stranger a drink of water and to
make his bed more comfortable in preparation
for the night, and gave no answer. So, thinking
little more of the fate of the outlaw of
whom he had been speaking, John strolled over
to a fallen treetop at the edge of a little hill a
dozen rods away, to gather an armful of dry
wood for the fire. Ring had gone on ahead of
him and now ran down into the valley where
there was a stream of water. Thinking the
dog was only wanting a drink, the boy paid no
attention to him, and was starting back to camp
when Ring came bounding forward, with some
strange object in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found now, old fellow?&rdquo;
demanded John, putting his wood down; for
Ring was constantly discovering bones and
other things in the woods, and carrying them
into camp. For answer the dog dropped the
strange object at his master&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gravy! Where did that come from?&rdquo;
was John&rsquo;s soliloquy, the indifference which
had first marked his tones quickly disappearing.</p>
<p>With deep interest he examined a small, oblong,
metal box, such as snuff was carried in
many years ago, turning it over and over, and
trying in vain to open it. The box was greatly
discolored and so dingy that John was not sure
of the quality of the metal, though he supposed
it to be silver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you find it, Ring?&rdquo; he asked, but
the dog only wagged his tail as his head was
patted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strange thing to find in such a
place as this,&rdquo; cried John, tossing the box to
Ree, as he reached the camp. &ldquo;Ring fetched
it up out of the valley yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; Ree asked interestedly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no name on it. Open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who has a better right,&rdquo; was
John&rsquo;s reply, and without more ado Ree struck
the edge of the box sharply against the heavy
wheel of the cart. A piece of paper, yellow and
water-stained, fell to the ground as the lid flew
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this will tell whose box it is,&rdquo; said
John, picking the paper up, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t too
dark to read it. Why, it&rsquo;s only a piece of some
old letter or something,&rdquo; he added, unfolding
a long half-sheet of the size commonly known
as foolscap. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no name at the beginning
or the end, that I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a woman&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; said Ree, looking
over his chum&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;But I guess it
doesn&rsquo;t amount to much. Some poor chap&rsquo;s
sweetheart wrote it, maybe, and he must have
carried it a long while before he lost it. I wish
we knew just where Ring got hold of it; for&rdquo;&mdash;and
Kingdom&rsquo;s voice sank to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;I
am afraid, John, it may be another case like
that of our friend in the cart here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s find out what it says,&rdquo; John answered
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too dark. It won&rsquo;t do to make a target
of ourselves by building enough fire to see
by, and we will have to let it go till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wisdom of Ree&rsquo;s remark about too much
firelight was very apparent, so John conquered
his curiosity by joking his companion about
the fear he had expressed that the snuff box
might have been found upon the person of
some white man cruelly murdered in the woods,
as Theodore Hatch had so nearly been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Ring got the box out of the man&rsquo;s
inside pocket, then buttoned his coat up
again,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>It was so unusual for Ree to take a gloomy
view of any circumstance or discovery, that,
realizing there was not much probability, after
all, that their dog had secured the box from
the body of some unfortunate hunter or explorer,
as he had suggested, he was quite bored
by John&rsquo;s fun. But he did not show it; that
would have been more unlike him still.</p>
<p>It is rather strange that, notwithstanding
that they had been talking of Ichabod Nesbit
just a minute or two before the strange box
was found by their dog, neither of the boys
thought of the outlaw in connection with the
odd discovery, in all their conversation about
the matter during the evening. The box they
rubbed and polished and made certain it was
silver, but no name or sign of whose property
it might have been did they discover, except
the torn piece of paper, the writing on which
it was too dark to read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The night passed without incident, and by
dividing the long hours of watching over the
camp and wounded stranger, both Ree and
John obtained some sleep and rest&mdash;enough
that with the coming of daylight each felt more
spry and fresh than at any time since the discovery
of the unconscious form of Theodore
Hatch had resulted in the breaking of their
slumbers.</p>
<p>John watered the horses at the brook in the
valley hard by and harnessed Neb while Ree
broiled some venison and toasted some corn
bread, brought from Pittsburg, for their breakfast.
As they sat on a small log within their
camp, eating and talking, the conversation
turned at once to the silver snuff box and its
written contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now read the letter, Ree; don&rsquo;t keep
a fellow waiting any longer,&rdquo; John demanded.</p>
<p>Kingdom secured the box from a small chest
in the cart, where it had been safely deposited
over night, and as John ate away, a piece of
bread in one hand, a piece of venison in the
other, watching with much interest all that his
friend did, the latter removed the lid and took
out the yellow-stained paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is not all here! The letter has
been torn in two right through the middle!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t notice that last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, land o&rsquo; Goshen! Read what you can!
I&rsquo;ve been waiting all night to find out what the
writing is, and now you behave as though we
had no interest in the thing!&rdquo; John cried with
an impatient laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read it! Look here! Now what can
be made out of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together the young men studied the writing.
As Ree had said, the document had been torn
squarely in two lengthwise, and that which remained
was so faded and so soiled that to read
it was difficult. By degrees, however, the
wording and letters were made out as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish we had the other part of that
letter!&rdquo; cried John Jerome, his eyes sparkling.
&ldquo;Somebody has been in this part of the country
looking for hidden treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears that that is what the whole thing
is about, but it isn&rsquo;t in this part of the country,&rdquo;
said Ree, more quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,
in the very beginning it says, &lsquo;Buried near
Philadel&rsquo;? Why, the rest of that word, which
is cut away, with the other half of the letter,
would make it Philadelphia, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;My! but I&rsquo;d like to stumble onto that chest,
just the same,&rdquo; was John&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Why, the
letter tells of gold and silver and jewels&mdash;maybe
it is pirates, Ree! For pity&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s
read it through again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much less excited than his companion, Ree
went over the writing once more, trying with
John, but in vain, to supply the missing words
at the end of each line. They could make out
nothing definite, though the more they studied
the more certain they were that some one had
written a description of the hiding place of
certain money and valuables, and then for
some reason cut the paper in two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The mystery about it all and the fascination
which the possibility of finding hidden treasure
has for every one, kept the two boys poring
over the writing and talking of it much longer
than they thought. Time passed so quickly
that half the forenoon was gone ere they could
put the subject by and prepare to resume their
journey.</p>
<p>His brain cooler and his thoughts more calm
than John&rsquo;s, as he continued to think of the
mysterious document, a happy idea came to
Ree&rsquo;s mind and he wondered that he had not
thought of it before. Why not try, with the
aid of Ring, to learn just where the silver
snuff box had lain? There might be something
to afford some clue to the owner of the box
close by, or it might be that he had been right
in suggesting that some poor fellow lay cold
in death not far away.</p>
<p>Without delay Kingdom told John of his
idea, and filled with a variety of expectations,
hopes and fears, that young man hailed the
thought with delight. Ring was called, and
the silver box held where he could see and
smell it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take it back, you rascal! Take it where
you found it!&rdquo; commanded Ree, talking that
tack with the dog, because he knew Ring would
understand better than if he asked him where
he had found the box.</p>
<p>John joined in the command, and a look of
understanding coming to the dog&rsquo;s eyes,
though the poor fellow showed that he thought
he was being scolded for having done something
wrong, he seized the box in his teeth and
trotted away.</p>
<p>With a hasty glance into the cart to see that
the wounded man was safe for the time being,
both boys set off at a little run to follow Ring.
Straight to the hillside and down into the valley
the dog went, then for a considerable distance
followed the stream therein.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Running around a clump of bushes, the dog
disappeared from view. A half minute later,
when Ree and John came up with him, he was
standing beside a pile of stones half covered
by brush. Under this little mound a woodchuck
or skunk had burrowed, and there were
evidences that Ring had started to dig out
whatever animal was inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose the silver box came out
of that hole, do you?&rdquo; John asked of Ree, his
tones showing disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the decisive answer, as
Kingdom pulled away some dead branches,
and lifted up a flat stone, &ldquo;but I do think that
the bones&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Ichabod Nesbit are under those rocks!&rdquo;
cried John, excitedly finishing the sentence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CABIN BY THE RIVER.</span></h2>
<p>With anxious haste John began tearing
away the brush from over the heap of stones
which, he was now certain, covered all that remained
of the body of Ichabod Nesbit, the outlaw,
whom Black Eagle, the Indian, had killed
a year before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember Black Eagle&rsquo;s telling us
that he placed stones on Nesbit&rsquo;s body, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he asked of Ree, who was working more
quietly, but no less industriously than himself.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Put stones on him and Great Spirit never
find him,&rsquo; he said, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Ree did remember these words of the Indian,
but he was thinking of something else, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can hunt here all day, John, and we
will find the bones of Nesbit under this pile of
stones and brush, I&rsquo;m sure; but the other half
of that letter is not here. I&rsquo;ll tell you where it
is, though. I&rsquo;ll bet a coonskin cap the chaps
we saw at the Eagle tavern have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember! You mean that piece of paper
or letter, or whatever it was, that they were
so afraid I&rsquo;d see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you recollect how curious they
were to know all we could tell them of
Nesbit, and how he was killed, but especially
where? As sure as shootin&rsquo; they have one half
of that paper telling where some one buried a
fortune, and they must have known that Ichabod
Nesbit had the other half! Why, it is as
plain as day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Five minutes later the boys had completely
uncovered the bones of a man. That they were
those of their one-time enemy, Ichabod Nesbit,
there could be no doubt. John recognized the
remnants of a blue homespun shirt which Nesbit
had worn, but Ree clinched the matter by
making the discovery that the skull of the skeleton
was missing. For they recalled how
Black Eagle had journeyed to this western
country and carried away the skull to convince
another Indian that he had really killed Nesbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Ree, quite sorrowfully.
&ldquo;Nesbit might have been a prosperous man if
he had but used his gifts in the right way. And
here he lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunderation! He would have killed us, if
Black Eagle hadn&rsquo;t killed him,&rdquo; John broke
out, almost indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we ought to give his bones as decent
a burial as possible, &rsquo;way off here; that is what
I was thinking of,&rdquo; Ree made answer. &ldquo;Yet,
we haven&rsquo;t time to do it now. Our friend up
there may have taken a delirious spell and fallen
out of the cart before we get back, as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Meanwhile the boys were searching the
ground about the skeleton carefully. They
found nothing, however, and rightly judged
that Black Eagle had taken all of Nesbit&rsquo;s
property which was in sight, for which he
cared, at the time he killed the man.</p>
<p>The manner in which their dog had chanced
to find the snuff box&mdash;the one thing which had
not been carried away&mdash;was plain. It had fallen
away from the rotted clothing still clinging
to the bones, at which unknown animals had
been gnawing, and was brought to light when
Ring tried to get at these burrowing creatures
in their holes.</p>
<p>Returning the stones and brush to the position
in which they had found them, but agreeing
to return some day and bury the skeleton
properly, Ree and John lost no time in hastening
back to their camp. The mystery of the
snuff box and the writing in it had been partially
solved, and now their thoughts were
again chiefly of reaching their long-deserted
cabin as speedily as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Within an hour after their discovery of the
lonely, last resting place of Ichabod Nesbit&rsquo;s
body, they were again making their way farther
and deeper into the wilderness, one of
whose manifold gloomy and terrible secrets
had that morning been revealed to them. They
little knew at that time what others were in
store.</p>
<p>The young emigrants were now not a great
deal more than one day of successful traveling
distant from the little log house on the bluff
above the Cuyahoga river, which had been,
and was again to be, their home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get there at dark, but
should have plenty of time to look about us and
get beds fixed up, and all that, when we do
reach the shanty,&rdquo; John Jerome told his chum.
&ldquo;We better go just as far as we can to-day, and
then maybe we can reach our house by noon
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ree accepted the suggestion as a good one,
and, though they did their best for the sick
man in the cart, Theodore Hatch, had he been
possessed of his senses, would have said he had
a pretty rough ride, as Neb was urged to the
best possible speed over the hilly, densely
wooded country through which the little party
was now traveling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Within a mile or two after leaving camp on
this day the boys passed through the valley
where their horse had been shot and killed on
their previous trip into the wilderness. There
stood the cart they had had, practically as they
had left it, but presenting a most forlorn appearance
with the rank grass and low bushes
growing up all about it. On examination,
however, the weather-beaten vehicle was found
to be in fairly good condition, and the two
friends determined that some time soon they
would return for it. Though they were already
provided with a strong, heavy cart, it
would be very convenient to have another in
case of accident, and as the abandoned property
was their own, there was no reason why
they should not reclaim it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>With the coming of another evening camp
was made not more than four miles, the boys
judged, from their destination. They exercised
the same care as before, and one remained
up with the wounded stranger and on
guard until morning; but save for the unusually
loud howling of a pack of wolves, finding
it harder to obtain food now that winter was
coming on, there was nothing to disturb the
lads throughout the night.</p>
<p>John did guard duty from some time after
midnight until dawn, and, taking a little walk
not far from camp at daybreak, saw and shot
a fine young deer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not want to move into our house
with an empty pantry,&rdquo; he delightedly told
Ree, the latter springing up upon hearing the
discharge of the rifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>John&rsquo;s elation over the killing of the deer
was quite unusual. It was not that such an
occurrence was uncommon or that he had made
an extremely good shot; but this was a very
important day to him. To Kingdom it was the
same&mdash;the day to which they had looked forward
for many months, and especially during
the weeks since they had left Connecticut; and
both were genuinely happy. The weather was
cool and bracing. Most of the trees were bare
and every stream was covered with floating
leaves, save where the current was strong
enough to sweep them away. All nature was
preparing for winter, and the effect was invigorating.
It made the young pioneers anxious
to do the same.</p>
<p>Except for the one Redskin who had shown
a hostile disposition, no trouble with any Indians
had been experienced. There was promise
that game would be no less abundant than
the previous winter, for the summer had been
favorable. There was a prospect, also, of
probably two weeks of Indian summer in which
to get ready for the colder, stormy weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Thus were the hearts of the two friends
light, and their hopes buoyant, as they began
their last day&rsquo;s journey. Their progress was
excellent, though the road was through the unbroken
forest. Every few minutes they recognized
some spot that they knew, as they
drew nearer and nearer to the home they
sought, and so did they come at last, when the
sun was still in midsky, to the top of the hill
from which, looking across the valley to the
high knoll rising beside the river, they could
see the cabin they had so hurriedly left six
months before.</p>
<p>John was driving. Ree had gone some distance
in advance of the cart but was waiting
for it to come up; and as though they read each
other&rsquo;s thoughts, the two lads went forward
together to a point which would afford them a
complete view of the little valley whose natural
clearing they had enlarged in their first work
of home building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Silently they stood side by side and gazed
upon the quiet scene. There was the cabin,
seemingly just as they had left it. Between it
and them was the little field of corn they had
planted. Indians had carried away most, if
not all, of the grain, it was plain to be seen;
but the stalks remaining showed that there
must have been a good yield. To the right was
the little plot of ground which they had
ploughed, after a fashion, for potatoes. The
grass and some weeds had so grown up there,
however, that it was impossible to determine
at once whether this crop had grown, and if so,
whether the potatoes had been stolen. Squashes
and beans had been planted in the same way,
and a closer investigation would need to be
made to discover what had come of the work
of the springtime, so far as these were concerned,
also.</p>
<p>All in all the deserted, lonesome look which
pervaded the scene made John blue and melancholy.
Quick to notice this, and anxious to
dispel such a feeling in his friend, Ree cheerily
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, John, there is a lot of grass
grown up on our farm, and we will need to
cut a lot of it for two horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me almost homesick,&rdquo; the other
answered with a sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks! We&rsquo;ve got too much to do
to be homesick! Wait here and keep your eye
on the cart while I scout over to the cabin. I&rsquo;ll
be back and help you down the hill, but we want
to know that all is serene before we drive into
the open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Ree trotted down the hill, skirted
the edge of the forest a little way, and then,
seeing that all was quiet, walked quickly across
the clearing and up the steep slope to the rude
little house. An involuntary, almost imperceptible
shudder passed over him as he noticed
at once the deep dents in the heavy door of the
cabin, recalled the attack which Big Buffalo
had led upon them, and saw a great dark blot
upon the threshold, which he knew had been
dyed there by blood of that fight.</p>
<p>But putting the gloomy thought from his
mind, with a determination such as he well
knew how to exercise, he pulled the latch-string
still hanging out, and pushed open the
door. A damp, musty odor greeted him, and
with only a hasty glance inside, and leaving the
door open to admit the fresh air, he turned
and hurried across the valley and up the hill to
where John was waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes wide open, Ree,&rdquo; Jerome
called out as Kingdom came near, &ldquo;that sneaking
Redskin is not far away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As all had been very quiet it was hard to understand
what John meant, but the latter pointed
to Ph&oelig;be, the wounded Quaker&rsquo;s mare, as
Ree asked for information, and it was enough.
The poor beast was terror-stricken as when
before it had scented that lone savage who had
so nearly killed its master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen a thing,&rdquo; Jerome went on,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll wager that the mare is not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As though in emphatic confirmation of
John&rsquo;s words, a rifle sounded and a bullet sped
through the canvas of the covered cart.</p>
<p>In an instant Return Kingdom&rsquo;s weapon was
in readiness. A streak of darker hue against
the background of the trees mid which he was
watching, darted like a shadow between two
large oaks. Quick as lightning the boy fired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>A piercing yell followed Ree&rsquo;s shot. John,
no slower than his companion to see the flitting
form of the Indian, dashing away among the
trees, also fired just as the savage screamed.
But there came no answering bullet or sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather guess we got him&mdash;one of us,&rdquo;
said John, exultingly. &ldquo;I never saw so slippery
a heathen, though. He glides along fast
as an arrow and with no more noise. Why, his
feet hardly touched the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having quickly reloaded his rifle, Ree was
watching keenly in all directions; but when no
sight or sound of the wary savage appeared, he
replied to his friend&rsquo;s remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slippery as an eel; maybe we <i>have</i> finished
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Careful search, however, failed to reveal to
the boys any trace of the Indian whose body
John had been quite confident they would find
stretched upon the leaves not far away. As he
had done before, the fellow had disappeared
instantly and completely as a puff of thin
smoke in a raging gale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Considerably disturbed, the lads took their
cart and horses down the hill and into the open
space between the forest and the cabin, with
the greatest caution. They had hoped they
were quit of their mysterious foe, and his sudden
reappearance, when there had been reason
to believe he was far away, was more than annoying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate we will have four good, strong
walls between ourselves and the murderous
scamp to-night,&rdquo; said John Jerome, as they
drove up the hill to the cabin. &ldquo;It is funny
that on our other trip we were mysteriously
shot at in just this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probably the fellow they told us of in
Pittsburg,&rdquo; Kingdom answered. &ldquo;I am glad
he hasn&rsquo;t tried to shoot the horses; maybe he
will let them alone. We will have to build a
lean-to for them, right away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>In a few minutes the journey which had
taken so long was over. The cart of the young
pioneers was drawn up before the cabin door,
and there was so much to be done in the next
hour or two that the prowling Redskin might
have been more successful in his secret attacks
than he had yet been, had he improved
the opportunity. Fortunately he did not, and
in a short time a bright fire was driving the
chill, damp air from the little log house, and a
bed was fixed up in a snug corner and Theodore
Hatch was carried to it. The horses were
watered and tethered near the door, and a late
dinner was prepared by John, while Ree proceeded
with the unloading of the cart.</p>
<p>Though still unconscious and so weak that he
could scarcely lift his hand, his threshing
about and calling out in delirium long since
over, no one seemed to feel the change in the
situation more than did the wounded stranger.
As was his custom, Ree gave him the best attention
in his power, before eating his own dinner,
and as he did so, could not but notice the
change for the better which his patient showed.
And he was not greatly surprised by the
greater change soon following.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Sitting astride a chest, a pewter plate between
them, the young pioneers were eating
their noonday meal when a groan came from
the stranger&rsquo;s rude couch. Immediately Ree
was at the man&rsquo;s side to make his position more
comfortable, and John arose to help, if necessary.</p>
<p>Slowly the Quaker&rsquo;s eyes opened. Slowly
there came into them a gleam of intelligence he
had not hitherto shown. Ree stooped to adjust
the coarse pillow under the injured head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I have been ill. What place is this,
young friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of Theodore Hatch, low and
weak, but clear and sane. No sound could have
given Return Kingdom or John Jerome
greater pleasure than this indication that their
work and worry and constant efforts to save
the life of this man, a stranger, but a human being
and brother white man still, would be rewarded
by seeing him recover. But his tones
were so pitifully feeble and his loss of strength
so complete, that John turned away, tears in
his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are still sick, and must lie very quiet,&rdquo;
Ree answered the unfortunate man in a gentle
voice. &ldquo;You are with friends who will do anything
they can for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to take a full minute for the man&rsquo;s
injured brain to comprehend what was said to
him. At last he seemed to remember what had
happened. There came a look of great alarm
upon his face, and in husky, deeply anxious
tones he said, struggling to rise up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast seen my saddle bags? Where&mdash;where
are they? Surely&mdash;surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are, all safe and sound,&rdquo; John
answered, as Ree gently bore the sufferer down
on his bed again; and as he felt his property
placed in his hands, the wounded Quaker, holding
them with all his remaining strength, allowed
his eyes to close. Soon he slept and it
required no doctor to tell that the crisis had
been passed and Theodore Hatch was on the
way to health again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE REWARD OF VIGILANCE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen what&rsquo;s inside those
saddle bags, Ree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Jerome asked the question when it was
certain that Theodore Hatch was sleeping, and
the more comfortably because the property to
which reference was made was clasped under
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took a shirt out of the bags, you know, to
make bandages. There was nothing in them
that I saw to make him so anxious about
them,&rdquo; Kingdom answered. &ldquo;Of course I
didn&rsquo;t see anything in them, nor look for anything
except something to tie up his wounds
with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;That man at Fort Pitt thought he had gold
in the bags, that he kept them close by him all
the time, you remember,&rdquo; John went on.
&ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t think there is any gold in them,
but maybe the other half of that letter about
those hidden valuables is there; that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve
been thinking; for don&rsquo;t you know how at first
he would call out for Ichabod Nesbit and ask if
he had the letter, and all that? Yes sir, Mr.
Hatch will be able to tell all about the paper
we found in Nesbit&rsquo;s snuff box, when he comes
to enough and gets strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong, John; see if you aren&rsquo;t.
Because if this man has the other part of the
letter, and was looking for Nesbit to get the
part he had, to put the two together, what was
that paper that Duff and Dexter had at the
Eagle tavern? Then, too, Duff and Dexter
were just such rough fellows as Nesbit and
might have been associated with him. But you
can&rsquo;t imagine this respectable Quaker and Nesbit
having anything to do with one another,
can you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Still John would not give in to Ree&rsquo;s way of
thinking, and as the argument was delaying
their work when there was much to be done,
the talk was discontinued.</p>
<p>The short afternoon came to a close before
the boys were fully prepared for evening.
Their goods were all unpacked and carried into
the cabin, where they lay in confusion. A
great pile of dry wood had been carried in, and
fresh, dry leaves gathered for beds, but no provision
had been made for shelter or protection
for the horses, and there were numerous spots
in which the cabin walls needed re-chinking to
keep out the wind; the hot summer sun having
baked the mud so dry that in places it had fallen
away from between the logs.</p>
<p>Without a word, when their supper was over,
Kingdom, taking a large blanket, hung it before
the fire in such a way that the cabin was
made quite entirely dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; demanded John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. Now I&rsquo;m going out, and you
close the door after me. With the blanket before
the fire, any one who might be watching
will need to look pretty close to see the door
opened and closed. And I&rsquo;m going to stay
outside all night, keeping in the shadow where
I won&rsquo;t be seen, and watch the horses and at
the same time watch for that slippery Redskin.
If I can capture him, I&rsquo;m going to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John started to answer, protesting that Ree
must not take the whole night of guard duty
upon himself; but his chum interrupted him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must appear to have gone to bed and be
sound asleep, so let the fire die down early. One
of us must be inside to watch Mr. Hatch, anyway,
and you must do that. When my eyes get
used to the darkness I can see all around the
clearing, and all I&rsquo;ll want of you is that you be
ready if I call you. If we are going to be
spied upon, we want to know it from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying no more, Kingdom slipped out of the
darkened cabin and to the darkest side of the
building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Quickly John closed the door, and drew the
blanket from in front of the fireplace. He saw
the wisdom of Ree&rsquo;s plan clearly, and was
ready to do his part. Hard as it was to remain
awake when he had planned on a good, sound
sleep, as they were carrying in leaves to make
soft beds, he resolved not to close his eyes. He
fixed a snug place in the chimney corner for the
dog, Ring, and then, as the stranger was resting
comfortably, to all appearances, he found
a seat on a deerskin on the floor, and with his
back against another, spread over a chest, settled
himself to wait and listen.</p>
<p>As the wind moaned dismally about the cabin
and the swish and tinkle of the water of the
river below came to his ears, he thought of Ree
outside in the cold, and remembered how ever
ready his chum was to take upon himself their
greatest burdens. Then he recalled the necessity
of their being ever keenly watchful, and
admiring Ree the more, as he thought of their
danger, told himself again that he must not
shut his eyes. Almost at the same moment his
chin dropped upon his chest, and, completely
worn out, he succumbed to the pleasant
warmth, to which he had not lately been accustomed,
and fell sound asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>By no means afraid, for he was almost fearless,
but considerably worried by the antics of
the Indian, who seemed able to appear and disappear
in a most startling and mysterious
manner, whenever he chose to do so, Kingdom
stationed himself in the shadows close to the
cabin wall, and vigilantly watched in all directions.
He was protected from the wind, but the
night air was cold and raw, and for want of
exercise he became quite chilled.</p>
<p>From all sides came at intervals the discordant
howls and screams of the beasts of the forest.
The melancholy dirges of the wind among
the trees added to the general gloom. Still
Kingdom courageously remained at his post,
though as the hours dragged by, and even the
horses, grazing a few yards from the cabin
door, were undisturbed, he felt that his labor
was lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Remembering, however, that the whole object
of his having undertaken this plan of
vigilance was to find out whether Indians or
other foes were spying upon himself and John,
and knowing that unless he watched all night
he would not know positively whether prowlers
had been about, the lad straightened himself up
and with renewed determination put behind
him a great temptation to go in and lie down,
and turn Ring out to keep guard until morning.
Still he saw no sign of any known or unknown
enemy and his interest in his self-imposed
task was beginning to wane again, when
a sound of footfalls in the leaves at the edge of
the forest, to the left of the cabin, came to him.</p>
<p>Grasping his rifle closer, Ree strained both
ears and eyes to detect the coming of&mdash;he was
sure it could be no one else than the Indian who
had been following upon their trail. In another
second there came out of the woods two
figures, carrying a canoe between them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Ree could not at once make out whether they
were Indians or white men in rough frontier
dress. Their burden seemed heavy, and as
they came nearer, heading toward a low place
in the bank beside the river, he observed that
the canoe was well filled, which accounted for
its seeming to weigh a great deal. At the same
time he discovered that the two men were Indians.
What were they doing? Why were they
traveling by night, in this manner?</p>
<p>Unseen by the Redskins, Ree watched them
narrowly. They had approached to within one
hundred yards of him to reach the river just
at the foot of the steep slope leading down
from the cabin, and so avoid going around a
growth of bushes upon the bank, to get to the
water.</p>
<p>Even in the dim moonlight the white boy
saw them clearly. Suddenly as a lightning
flash, he realized what the savages were doing.
He recognized the canoe they carried. It was
his own and John&rsquo;s&mdash;the one which, with other
property that they had been unable to take
with them, they had hidden in a great hollow
log a quarter of a mile away, when leaving the
cabin to hurry to Connecticut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>It was more than probable that these two Indians
had found the canoe some time before
and had planned to steal it. Their discovery
that the two boys had returned and would soon
regain possession of the craft and their other
belongings prompted the Redskins to make
haste to carry the canoe and goods away before
this should happen.</p>
<p>Sure that he was correct in thus reasoning,
but desirous of making no hard feelings with
the Indians over the matter, Ree adopted a
novel plan. As the savages set their burden
down preparatory to the launching of the
canoe, the boy walked quickly toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do, friends,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real
kind of you to bring us our canoe so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never were two savages so completely taken
by surprise, or more at a loss to know what to
do or say. There was such kindness in Kingdom&rsquo;s
tones that they were not sure whether
his remark was meant to be sarcastic or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>One of the Indians made a leap as though he
would run away. The other, with the savage
&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; uttered in a tone so ridiculously crestfallen
that Kingdom could hardly suppress a
laugh, stood still.</p>
<p>Walking quickly up to the Redskin, Kingdom
gave him a hearty handshake, seeing which the
other Indian approached, somewhat after the
manner of a small boy who fears punishment,
and also shook hands.</p>
<p>Ree would have liked to talk with the Indians
and learn the general situation as to the progress
of hostilities in the northwest and the state
of affairs along the frontier, but they were too
chagrined to remain. The two agreed, however,
to return at some future time for presents
Kingdom promised them in return for
their having carried the canoe and its heavy
load to the cabin.</p>
<p>He recognized them, just before they were
leaving, as Beaver Hair and Long Arrow, Mingoes
who had called at the cabin once or twice
the previous winter, and was anxious to make
friends of them. This he undoubtedly succeeded
in doing, for the savages knew that had
he been disposed to open fire upon them he
could probably have killed them both; and in
their eyes he would have been justified in doing
so, having caught them in the act of stealing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Long afterward it developed that Beaver Hair
and Long Arrow were, as was true of most Indians,
honest; but they had obtained fire water of
a trader near where the Cuyahoga empties into
Lake Erie, and were not in their right senses
when, as they were paddling up the river, they
discovered that the boy traders had just returned
to the cabin, and they, having long ago
discovered where the canoe was hidden, concealed
themselves to await a favorable time for
carrying the property off.</p>
<p>That they were caught in the act they attributed
to two things, the anger of the Great
Spirit and the keen scent of Kingdom, whom
from that night they called &ldquo;White Fox&rdquo;; for
they believed that it was some powerful sense
of smell possessed by Ree which had awakened
him and resulted in their being discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Kingdom watched the two Indians as they
disappeared down the river, and as he walked
up the slope to the cabin, looking carefully for
any other visitors, he saw the gray light of another
day upon the eastern horizon. Still he
loitered in the darker shadows, but when it was
well-nigh daylight, and all continued quiet, he
quietly entered the cabin, thinking to get some
rest.</p>
<p>Fast asleep, just as he had settled himself
down to wait and watch, his back against a skin-covered
chest, Ree found John, and smiled as
he immediately guessed that his chum had set
out to remain awake all night, and resolved to
have some fun. Thin ice had formed on a shallow
puddle of water at the foot of the hill, and
securing a small piece Ree placed it on John&rsquo;s
bare head. For a few seconds the sleeper did
not stir, but just as the cold was penetrating to
the scalp and John moved uneasily, Ree spoke
in deep, unnatural tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injun get scalp heap quick! Heap nice
scalp!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>With a yell, John leaped to his feet, his
hands flying to his head only to encounter his
wet hair.</p>
<p>Ree had leaped into a corner where he was
not immediately seen, while John, his senses
not yet collected, but bewildered and really
alarmed, seized his rifle and sprang to a loop
hole. In another moment, however, he heard
his friend&rsquo;s laughter. Then he guessed what
had happened; but he did not look around.
Still staring out of the loop hole, he said in the
most ordinary tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though it would be a nice day,
Ree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was quite a chilly night,&rdquo; Kingdom answered
in the same manner, stirring the coals
of the fire, and getting down on his knees to
blow them.</p>
<p>And not once that day was the joke referred
to. Afterward John said that the first impression
he had as he felt the ice on his head was
that his hair was on fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>John was much surprised but equally pleased
as he learned of Ree&rsquo;s adventure of the night,
and could not wait until after breakfast to run
down to the foot of the slope to inspect the
canoe. He found that it was only a little
warped by reason of having been out of the
water all summer, and the kettle and other
articles they had left with it, were also in good
condition.</p>
<p>Awakened from his long sleep at last, but
still keeping his precious saddle bags under
one arm, Theodore Hatch was telling Ree that
he felt much improved, as John returned to the
cabin.</p>
<p>Indeed, the mysterious stranger was looking
vastly better than at any time yet, and when
breakfast was ready, ate quite heartily,
propped up on the rude bed he occupied. He
inquired about his mare, Ph&oelig;be, before he
asked anything else, and that led to the telling
of the whole story of how he had been found
and cared for by the boys. With much feeling
the Quaker expressed his gratitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was traveling into the wilderness unarmed,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I am a man of peace, as
are all those of our faith. I have met hostile
Indians at different times, but when they saw
who and what I was, they made no movement
toward molesting me. I cannot understand
why I was attacked, but it must have been because
of the failing light, and my assailant,
whoever he was, may not have seen rightly. It
was just at evening as I prepared to spend the
night beside a little thicket. I saw no one, but
heard a shot and fell with the wound in my
side. I was still conscious as a young Indian
ran up to me and beat me on the head with his
hatchet. Then I knew no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Theodore Hatch put up his
hand to feel his injured head. A look of horror
and mental anguish came to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I scalped?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>John was almost ready to laugh over the
Quaker&rsquo;s despairing tone, but kept a straight
face, and Ree in answer to the question soberly
nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;The poor, deluded sinner,&rdquo; groaned the
stranger. &ldquo;I have forgiven mine enemies always&mdash;always.
I must&mdash;I will&mdash;aye, I do, truly
forgive him. He did not know I was a man of
peace. Oh, why did I come into these forests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why did you, sir?&rdquo; asked John Jerome,
quite respectfully, but brimming over
with curiosity, as he remembered the Quaker&rsquo;s
embarrassment when the name of Ichabod Nesbit
had been mentioned at Pittsburg. He
turned around on his three-legged stool and
looked the older man squarely in the face as
he asked the question, but Ree to hide his embarrassment
rose and looked out of a loop hole.</p>
<p>The stranger made no answer, but giving Jerome
a startled, searching look, seemed to hug
the saddle bags under his arm the closer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FATE OF BLACK EAGLE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Hatch better not talk any more
now,&rdquo; said Return Kingdom, quickly looking
around and noticing the Quaker&rsquo;s flushed, excited
manner. &ldquo;You must be careful, you are
still so weak,&rdquo; the boy continued, adjusting the
straw-filled bolster for the man to lie down
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm by my question,&rdquo;
John spoke up, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou didst no harm, young friend, but almost
frightened me,&rdquo; the stranger answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>So the incident passed leaving the boys more
curious than ever to know the history and true
identity of Theodore Hatch. Ree would not
confess that he was especially anxious to learn
these things, because his fear of wounding the
man&rsquo;s feelings would not permit him to question
the stranger; but John openly vowed that
he meant to find out just who and what the
stranger was, and would do so sooner or later.
And in time the boys did ascertain all they
could have wished to know, but in ways quite
unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done, building
a horse shed and all,&rdquo; said Ree, when the two
friends were outside the cabin after the talk
with Theodore Hatch, &ldquo;but in spite of that, one
of us should go back along the trail and bury
the bones of Ichabod Nesbit. I&rsquo;m afraid that
some day our Quaker will ask to be taken to the
place, and he would not think very well of us
if he found things just as they were left.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>John fell in with this suggestion heartily, but
it was agreed that there would be time to perform
the task spoken of, two or three days
later, and meanwhile some inkling of the whereabouts
of the lone Indian might be obtained.
Thus it was that after some discussion it was
decided that Ree should go that very day to the
village of the Delawares on the lake a few miles
away, to learn all he could of this particular
savage and the disposition of the Indians in
general, while at the same time he showed the
people of Captain Pipe, the Delaware chieftain,
that the lads desired to renew their
friendly relations with them. John would remain
with the stranger to care for him and
guard the cabin, giving his work the while to
cutting small logs with which to build a barn.</p>
<p>Taking some presents for the Delawares,
Ree set out at about nine o&rsquo;clock, promising to
be home by dark. John shouldered his axe and
went to work. It had been Ree&rsquo;s first plan to
make his trip on horseback, but resolving that
it would be safer to slip through the woods very
quietly until he found out just what the situation
with reference to the Indians was, he traveled
on foot, and soon found himself upon the
familiar portage trail leading from the Cuyahoga
river to the headwaters of the Tuscarawas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Ree knew the way perfectly, for he had traveled
the route several times the previous winter.
He felt no harm for his safety, but kept
his eyes wide open and pushed forward among
the great oaks and beech trees stealthily and
rapidly. He saw no Indians but once or twice
when splendid shots of game might have been
made, he ignored them for safety&rsquo;s sake. Leaving
the beaten trail after an hour&rsquo;s traveling,
he made directly through the woods to the
lake. Without seeing any human creature he
approached the Indian town.</p>
<p>An air of loneliness hung over the place. Instead
of smoke rising from two score or more
of fires, in and among the rude log and bark
houses and wigwams, the few columns of blue
vapor which ascended seemed to show that the
village was almost deserted.</p>
<p>This was true. No one remained in the
usually lively home of Captain Pipe save a
number of children and old men and squaws.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;ugh!&rdquo; grunted an old warrior,
smoking his pipe in a sunny place. He recognized
Ree at once and held out his hand.</p>
<p>In a few minutes a half dozen aged men of
the tribe had gathered around and all gave the
young trader welcome. They could speak little
English and though Ree knew some Delaware
words their efforts at conversation were
so poorly rewarded that one of the Indians
went to call an interpreter.</p>
<p>To Ree&rsquo;s surprise and pleasure the person
summoned was Gentle Maiden, the daughter of
Captain Pipe, a young woman thoroughly deserving
of the pretty name the Moravian missionaries
had bestowed upon her. From them
she had learned the language of the &ldquo;Long-knives&rdquo;
and with her Kingdom could communicate
readily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Gentle Maiden had no hesitancy in answering
questions. She said her father and his
warriors were still in the northwest country
and might be absent all winter. Even lately
runners had been in the neighborhood to call
all able-bodied men to join the braves who had
first gone forth for the expected fighting, and
no Indians remained in the vicinity save those
who were too old to go to war, and some of the
women and children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Big Buffalo?&rdquo; asked Ree, referring to
the Redskin who had given himself and John
so much trouble and from whom he had made
his escape in the nick of time after the attack
upon their cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Buffalo is with the rest,&rdquo; said Gentle
Maiden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an Indian&mdash;not a Delaware, I
think&mdash;but one who roams the forests alone and
is not a friend of the Palefaces. What of him?
He is still about here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not of my father&rsquo;s people,&rdquo; was the
Indian girl&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many wanderers in the forests;
many of our race have been driven, even like
yonder leaves in the wind, before the coming
of the Long-knives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The answer puzzled Kingdom. It was apparent
that the Indian girl wished not to tell
what she knew of the mysterious Redskin, and
that her sympathy was with him, though she
declared herself still friendly to the young
traders who had bought land of her father a
year earlier.</p>
<p>With genuine Indian hospitality the Indians
brought food for Ree, but he noticed that it
was of inferior quality and not so generous in
quantity as usual&mdash;only a handful of parched
corn. He ate, however, to show his friendliness,
and after a time, leaving his gifts, a
string of glass beads and a large pocket knife,
with the Delawares, bade them good-bye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Reaching home some time before sundown,
Ree found that John had passed a quiet, busy
day. Under these favorable circumstances, as
he was almost completely exhausted by his
long hours of watchfulness the night before,
this following, too, upon many nights of broken
rest, he said that Ring might do guard and both
himself and John would turn in early. To this
the latter would not listen, however, saying he
would remain awake to keep an eye on the
horses lest some wild beast attack them, if nothing
more. He could remain in the cabin and
do this, peering frequently through a loop hole,
he said.</p>
<p>This, their second night in the cabin, passed
quietly. Once toward morning Ph&oelig;be, the
Quaker&rsquo;s mare, snorted and trembled violently,
but John saw or heard no cause for alarm,
though the horse&rsquo;s action undoubtedly indicated
that the lone Indian was somewhere near.</p>
<p>Agreeing that this was almost certainly the
case, the boys were especially watchful as they
were about their work next day and for many
days afterward. No night passed, either, until
their lean-to stable was completed, but that one
of the young men stood guard, much to the
alarm of Theodore Hatch, who feared an attack
upon the cabin at any time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>This thought did not worry either Ree or
John. The tactics of their solitary foe, they
were now certain, were not to fight in the open,
but to shoot from some safe distance; and he
had shown such fear for his own safety by always
disappearing immediately after he had
fired a shot, that both lads held him more or
less in contempt. Still, they realized the constant
danger the Redskin placed them in, and
though they had not made an open agreement
to that effect, each boy knew that he wanted
only the proper opportunity to shoot the Indian
dead.</p>
<p>How differently they felt afterward, at least
for a time, had no bearing on their plans at
this time. They only knew that it was a case of
kill or be killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The days passed rapidly. There was so
much to do that it seemed that deep snows
might make hunting a difficult task rather than
a pleasure, before they could get to it. No
sooner was the barn built than the corn, or all
that remained of it, had to be gathered and
stored away&mdash;the fodder stacked against the
stable, the ears hung over the rafters of the
cabin,&mdash;and the few scattered potatoes which
remained, harvested. Of the latter there was
scarcely more than enough for seed for the following
spring, and to supplement their store of
food in addition to the meat they might always
have, nuts were gathered&mdash;beech nuts, chestnuts,
hickory nuts and butternuts.</p>
<p>When all this had been done there was grass
to be stored away for the horses. It scarcely
deserved the name of hay&mdash;the long grass
which grew in open spots along the valley; but
quite a large stack of it was laboriously harvested
with no tools other than a scythe and
home-made rake.</p>
<p>Thus more than two weeks passed, and Theodore
Hatch, as much a mystery as ever, was becoming
strong enough to dress himself and
walk about for a few minutes at a time, when
Ree again reminded John of the necessity of
their giving the bones of Ichabod Nesbit a decent
interment. The result was that John proposed
to go himself, on horseback, the following
day, and perform the task referred to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>So it was agreed, and allowing the Quaker to
rest under the impression that he was going
back along their trail only to bring up the old
cart, which for more than a year had stood exposed
to the weather in the ravine where it had
been left, John started off at daylight on a
clear, frosty morning. The fine air and the
beautiful, peaceful quiet of the woods, broken
only by the occasional call of wild turkeys or
the chattering of squirrels and other small animals,
put the younger of the boy pioneers in a
most happy frame of mind.</p>
<p>Neb, having done little work for more than a
fortnight, was also in high spirits and needed
no urging to trot or gallop wherever the forest
was sufficiently open to permit it. Good progress
being made, therefore, horse and rider
reached and crossed the gully where the
abandoned cart stood, by the middle of the
forenoon. Proceeding more slowly then, for
the trail was becoming more difficult for traveling,
they approached the spot they sought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the ride at all, but I shan&rsquo;t enjoy
playing sexton, I know,&rdquo; John was saying
to himself, as he dismounted to lead Neb down
the hill sloping to the brook beside which Ichabod
Nesbit&rsquo;s bones lay, and casting about for a
suitable place to tie the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John spoke beneath his breath, and his heart
beat fast. Angry voices came to his ear, and
they were not far away.</p>
<p>Slipping the bridle rein over a branch, the
lad went cautiously forward, keeping behind
the thicket which skirted the stream.</p>
<p>Again the voices were heard. Undoubtedly
they were those of white men engaged in violent
argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the Quaker, blast him!&rdquo; one coarse
voice exclaimed. &ldquo;And you, you Indian dog,
said not a word about him till now! Why
didn&rsquo;t you tell us you had told him where you
killed the man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Scarcely was this sentence spoken when John
reached a point not more than fifty feet from
the source of the angry contention where he
could see, but, hidden by the thick brush, escaped
being seen.</p>
<p>There stood Duff and Dexter, the men he
and Ree had met at the Eagle tavern, and also
Hank Quilling, the proprietor of that disreputable
establishment. With them was an Indian,&mdash;and&mdash;could
it be possible that he was associating
with such rogues?&mdash;John almost whistled
for amazement. The Redskin was his old
friend, Black Eagle.</p>
<p>Duff was speaking. His rage was terrible as
he pointed his finger menacingly at the Indian
and cried out, as the Mohawk stood haughtily
erect, his arms folded upon his chest, though
his eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast your red hide! I could&mdash;by the Eternal,
I <i>will</i>&mdash;kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a tremendous oath, the white man
raised his rifle and quick as flash discharged it,
the muzzle almost touching Black Eagle&rsquo;s
body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>It was all over in an instant. The bullet sped
to the Indian&rsquo;s heart; the poor fellow fell
senseless, dying at his slayer&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, man! Would you bring a whole
tribe of warriors down on us! An&rsquo; us away off
here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the proprietor of the Eagle tavern
who was speaking now, gasping the words
chokingly, frightened and dazed by the brutal
murder committed.</p>
<p>Before he could say more, John Jerome
sprang among them. So quickly and noiselessly
had he emerged from the brush that he
was not seen till his angry voice came shrill
and harsh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fiends! You fiends! Oh, I hope I&rsquo;ll
see you hanged for this! What does it mean!
Shooting Black Eagle down like a wolf&mdash;or&mdash;or
a beast! And he was more a decent man
than all three of you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>With a curse upon the boy, Duff sprang forward
and bore him down. Together they fell
heavily, the murderer foaming at the mouth
like a mad dog, in the violence of his rage, his
evil, disfigured face almost black and horrible
to behold, while his companions stood aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get us into no trouble, Duff! You
don&rsquo;t know what yer doin&rsquo; when yer blood&rsquo;s
up!&rdquo; Dexter protested, hurrying to the combatants
and trying to draw his villainous companion
away, the man and boy rolling over and
over in their fierce struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make short work of it, Duff, whatever you
do! There&rsquo;s another o&rsquo; them boys, an&rsquo; he may
be here any minute&mdash;an&rsquo; Injuns, too!&rdquo; yelled
Quilling, the landlord, jumping about in his
fear and excitement, and ending with&mdash;&ldquo;Fight
it out, dang ye! Ye&rsquo;ve had a noose round yer
neck &rsquo;fore now, but nobody kin say I killed the
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these words the fellow threw his
rifle over his shoulder and ran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do no good to kill him&mdash;won&rsquo;t do
no good, Duff,&rdquo; Dexter kept gasping, still trying
to pull his friend away, though his efforts
were puny as a child&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you&mdash;curse you for two cowardly
fools!&rdquo; Duff yelled, again and again, vainly
trying to get his hands on John Jerome&rsquo;s
throat. And then he looked to see whither
Quilling had retreated.</p>
<p>The boy, struggling beneath the man&rsquo;s greater
weight, needed no better opportunity. He
managed to get one foot quickly free and letting
it drive with all his force against his assailant&rsquo;s
middle, sent the fellow rolling upon
the ground.</p>
<p>The next second John was upon his feet, his
rifle at his shoulder. Dexter was already running
to overtake the fleeing landlord, and Duff,
picking himself up, looked first at John, then
at his runaway friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he said, slowly and distinctly, in
tones more of deep, deliberate hate than anger,
&ldquo;I was minded to kill you the night you spied
on us at that dirty hole of Quilling&rsquo;s. There
are reasons why I am going to let you go
again&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s one!&rdquo; snapped the boy, defiantly
raising his rifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;You impudent &mdash;&mdash; but I&rsquo;m not through
with you yet.&rdquo; Duff&rsquo;s voice was low, though
deeply, bitterly threatening. But he was interrupted&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you march!&rdquo; commanded John Jerome,
and his voice was stern and sharp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let daylight into that black heart of yours, right
here, and now, if you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boldly, not once turning his head to see if
the rifle&rsquo;s muzzle still covered him, Duff strode
away; but he called to his companions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, you blasted idiots! but I miss my
guess if I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s got something
you&rsquo;d like blasted well to get hold of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the rough fellow disappeared among the
trees, John still watching, an Indian, who, unobserved,
had seen the killing of Black Eagle,
stole away through the bushes and vanished
as silently as he had come and as he had
watched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CAMP IN THE TREE-TOP.</span></h2>
<p>Until Duff was out of view John held his
rifle ready for immediate use. As he turned
from watching the retreating figure of the
wretch, his gaze fell upon the outstretched
form of the dead Indian&mdash;the staring, lustreless
eyes and powder-burned, blood-stained
body presenting a horrid sight. Near by the
brush and stones were thrown aside and the
bones of Ichabod Nesbit were scattered all
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see it all now,&rdquo; came slowly and solemnly
from the boy&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;It is plain as anything
ever was! It was the letter they wanted;
and to think that those miserable cut-throats
made poor Black Eagle come all this
distance to show them where Ichabod Nesbit
lay, only to shoot him down in such a manner,
when they didn&rsquo;t find it! What was it that
Duff was saying, too? Ree will want to know
every word: &lsquo;It was the Quaker, blast him!&rsquo;
that is what he said. &lsquo;And you, you Indian
dog, said nothing about him.&rsquo; Well! I wonder
if Theodore Hatch wasn&rsquo;t on his way here to
find that letter, himself, and if Black Eagle
didn&rsquo;t direct him where to come. Poor Black
Eagle! Ichabod Nesbit was the cause of your
death at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So communing with himself in thoughts and
frequent murmured words, John spent a half
hour so deeply buried in his reflections concerning
the murder of the unfortunate Indian,
the likelihood that the murderer might be
brought to the rope&rsquo;s end as he so richly deserved,
and the mystery of the letter describing
the buried treasure, that he did not realize
how swiftly time was passing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>A loud whinny from Neb brought the pondering
lad to the remembrance that he had
much to do, and that already it was noon.
Hurrying up the hill he obtained the shovel,
fastened to Neb&rsquo;s harness as a means of carrying
it conveniently, and led the horse nearer
the scene of his labors.</p>
<p>His first task would be to dig a grave; but
a new problem appeared. Undoubtedly he
must bury the body of Black Eagle as well as
the bones of Nesbit. It seemed too dreadful
to place them together&mdash;the remains of this
white man who had killed the Indian&rsquo;s son, and
those of the Indian who had been revenged for
the act, only to meet his own death after showing
Palefaces, whom he believed to be friends,
where the outlaw&rsquo;s body lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there will have to be two graves,&rdquo;
John decided, and a glance at the sun told him
he must work hard if he was to return to the
cabin before another day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Fortunately the earth was not frozen beneath
its thick covering of leaves, and except for the
many roots he encountered, the lonely young
sexton of the wilderness made rapid progress.
One trench of sufficient length and depth for
the purpose, at the foot of a large ash tree,
which could be made to serve as a headstone,
he had completed when a rustling of the leaves
caused him to look quickly up. Duff, Dexter,
and Quilling stood before him, the last named
grinning wolfishly over John&rsquo;s surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who killed the Indian known as Black
Eagle?&rdquo; asked Duff, in cold accusing tone,
pointing his finger at the boy, who had hastily
thrown down his shovel and picked up his rifle,
instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; chorused Dexter and Quilling,
pointing their fingers also at John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who saw him do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All three of us,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swear that this is true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we do; we saw him shoot the
Indian,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boy,&rdquo; Duff began, calmly sitting
down on a log, his rifle in both hands, while
his eyes never left the face of the lad he so
monstrously accused, &ldquo;you heard what was said.
They&rsquo;ve hanged men for killing peaceable Redskins
before now, and will do it again. Just
let us tell what we know at Fort Pitt, and you
are pretty likely to stretch a rope. You killed
Black Eagle; we saw you do it&mdash;never mind,
now! Let me talk! I say we saw you shoot
the Indian down. We can set all the Mingoes
west of the Ohio against you, or we can have
you hanged. We haven&rsquo;t just decided which
we&rsquo;d rather do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;you black liar, what are you
talking about?&rdquo; cried John, succeeding at last
in getting a word in, as Duff paused. &ldquo;Do you
suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind what I suppose; but we
can make you a heap of trouble, because, you
know, we saw you kill the Indian&mdash;shoot him
down in cold blood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>And here a villainous smile flitted over the
marked and loathsome face of the wretch; but
he scarcely paused, and there was no suspicion
of a smile in the cold harshness of his voice as
he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can make you and the pompous young
gentleman you call Kingdom sweat blood, or
hang your scalps on the belts of the Mingoes,
without the least trouble to ourselves. But we
don&rsquo;t propose to do that. We have nothing
against you young shavers, and don&rsquo;t want to
have. All we want is the paper writing you got
from the body of Ichabod Nesbit. Oh yes, we
know you got it. What were you coming here
to bury the bones for, if you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As one who thinks he has asked a question
which cannot be answered, Duff, squinting in
a most horrid manner and shaking his finger
viciously, paused for a reply.</p>
<p>John was thinking fast. He knew that the
murderous trio who faced him would not hesitate
to kill if they thought he had the missing
half of the hidden fortune letter in his possession.
He also knew from the words he had
heard Duff use in speaking of Black Eagle, that
he had at first believed the letter had fallen into
the Quaker&rsquo;s hands. Did he know where that
gentleman then was? It was hardly likely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>In infinitely less time than the telling of it
requires, the alert young pioneer thought of
these things and without even seeming to hesitate,
he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell me what you are trying to
get at; and for the matter of that, what are you
doing here? What reason had you for killing
Black Eagle the way you did, and he without
even a hatchet to defend himself? You can&rsquo;t
put that wicked, cold-blooded murder onto me
by lying, any more than you can fly. What&rsquo;s
more, you can&rsquo;t scare me by saying you&rsquo;ll swear
I killed the Indian! So I tell you right here,
Mr. Duff, that I want no more to do with you.
You guessed right in thinking I came here to
bury all that&rsquo;s left of Ichabod Nesbit. It is because
my partner and I have civilized feelings.
Anything else you want to know you can ask
about at the next house. What was Ichabod
Nesbit to you, anyway? If you ever had any
friendship for him, why shouldn&rsquo;t you turn in
here and help with his grave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>With such rapidity did John speak, his voice
growing in vehemence as he continued, that
Duff was bothered to find an immediate answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see no Quaker feller &rsquo;round
here, an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t he got no letter like Duff said?&rdquo;
squeaked Dexter, over Duff&rsquo;s shoulder, in his
peculiar gasping tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you!&rdquo; commanded Duff, turning
to his companion savagely. &ldquo;Who said anything
about a Quaker?&rdquo; And then to John in
the same tones: &ldquo;Now we have no time for
foolishness, bub! We want information and,
by heaven, we propose to have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the hideous fellow leaped toward
the boy as though to seize him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back there!&rdquo; the lad cried, clubbing
his rifle, unwilling to shoot, much as he was inclined
to do so, unless it were absolutely necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grab him! Grab him, you blasted fools!&rdquo;
yelled Duff furiously, and Dexter and Quilling,
who ran to their leader&rsquo;s side, attempted to do
so.</p>
<p>Dodging the fellows, John dealt a stunning
blow on Duff&rsquo;s head with the butt of his rifle,
then, springing to one side, escaped the terrific
lunge the brute made toward him, and in another
second he had leaped upon Neb&rsquo;s back,
Dexter and Quilling being not five yards away.
He seized the reins from the branch over which
they were thrown, and a word was enough to
set the horse off at a gallop.</p>
<p>A bullet whistled over John&rsquo;s shoulder as he
bent down to avoid the low limbs of the trees,
and the terrible tones of Duff, as in the vilest
language he cursed his companions for being
too slow, rang in his ears.</p>
<p>One other shot was fired but it went wide.
For five minutes he gave Neb free rein, then
knowing that he was, for the time being, safe,
he stopped, nervous and excited, and doubting
if his conduct had been either brave or wise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it was three against one and those fellows
would have tried to make me tell all I
know about that letter, and Duff&rsquo;s temper is so
awful! He would have killed me, like as not,
if I would not tell him anything,&rdquo; John reasoned,
persuading himself that he had done well
to escape.</p>
<p>What was next to be done? That was the
all-important question, after all. Its answer,
John decided, depended entirely on what Duff
and his agreeable companions meant to do, and
he resolved to ascertain their intentions.</p>
<p>Without further loss of time, therefore, the
boy fastened Neb&rsquo;s reins to a branch as he had
done before, and with great caution hurried
back along the trail. If he were being followed,
he could soon find it out. If the murderers
were gone, he might return and complete
the task he had set out to perform.</p>
<p>Expecting to see Duff and the others coming
toward him at any moment, John made haste
slowly, and half an hour passed before he again
came within sight of the little valley where the
day&rsquo;s terrible tragedy had been enacted. The
three men were not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Where were they? To answer the question,
the young man who asked it of himself continued
on, going in the direction in which Quilling
and Dexter had disappeared just after the murder
of Black Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have a camp near by,&rdquo; John told
himself as he hurried along, quietly as possible,
though the leaves under his feet seemed to rustle
loudly as though calling out that he was
coming, adding to his fears.</p>
<p>But he was right. Not much more than a
quarter of a mile away was a great tree, uprooted
by the wind; and partially concealed by
the branches of its top upon the ground, he
discovered Duff, Dexter and Quilling. They
were for the most part hidden by the limbs of
the fallen oak and had not John been very
watchful he would not have discovered them
without being seen himself. As it was, he doubted
his ability to approach nearer without revealing
his presence to the fellows. That they
were talking he knew by their gestures, but not
a word could he hear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Prudence prompted the boy to turn back and
hurry home to tell Ree everything that had
happened. Then he thought how anxious his
chum would be to know what Duff&rsquo;s plans were;
and so, yielding to his own curiosity and a desire
to obtain this information, he made a wide
half-circle and approached the fallen tree,
shielded from view by the mass of earth still
clinging to its upturned roots. These very
roots, however, which served him so well for
the one purpose, entirely prevented his hearing
what was being said by the men, though he was
now quite near. With great care, then, he
crept around to the trunk of the tree and keeping
close beside it, on his hands and knees
crawled forward. Now he could hear the conversation
of the fellows, and under the protection
of a great limb which projected from the
trunk fifty feet from the tree&rsquo;s base, he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t noway stand to reason that the
Quaker ain&rsquo;t got the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>John knew that it was Dexter who was talking,
though he could not see. The wheezy
voice could be no other&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is he? That&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m getting
at. We could fix him in short order, if we
only knew that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, sharply spoken, were surely
Duff&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to say is, that I wish I was to
home&mdash;I do, by gum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the landlord, tired, probably, of
sleeping out at night, and working and walking
by day. John knew his voice, also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you were!&rdquo; came the
voice of Duff, disgustedly, &ldquo;but all the miserable,
sneaking robbing of travelers&rsquo; clothes at
night, that you ever did wouldn&rsquo;t be a drop in
the bucket beside this buried fortune if we can
only get hold of it. No man knows better than
me what a lot of wealth that chest has in it&mdash;unless
it be that Quaker, blast him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might go back to Fort Pitt for a
spell, anyhow, an&rsquo; rest up,&rdquo; suggested Quilling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a jugful!&rdquo; Duff answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
follow those blasted youngsters up, and find
out what they know. Like as not they, and not
the Quaker, have got that letter. They&rsquo;re a
blamed sight sharper than you give &rsquo;em credit
for, and the next time you let one of &rsquo;em get
away from you, I&rsquo;ll boot you seven ways for
Sunday, see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duff&rsquo;s tones were full of emphasis, and it
was all very interesting to the boy concealed
behind the tree trunk and the giant limb. But
he heard no more; for with, &ldquo;So, now, stir
yourselves,&rdquo; the chief of the conspirators
walked out from the tree-top. He went toward
a small beech in which John now noticed that
the quarters of a deer had been hung, beyond
the reach of wolves.</p>
<p>The fellow&rsquo;s course took him within a few
yards of the hidden boy, but he passed on, unconscious
of the eyes which watched him.</p>
<p>Knowing that in returning to the camp with
the deer Duff would be almost certain to see
him, John waited only till the man&rsquo;s back was
toward him, then leaped to his feet and ran.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE QUAKER&rsquo;S STORY.</span></h2>
<p>Now it happened that Hank Quilling, the
tavern keeper, was gazing straight toward the
spot where John was concealed at the moment
the boy sprang up, as if out of the earth. The
surprise that the fellow suffered as he saw the
lad so upset him that he could do nothing but
yell, and yell lustily he did:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes, Duff! There he goes! Stop
him, Duff, stop him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Duff, likewise taken by surprise, and being
under the impression at first, as he heard the
leaves rustle under the flying boy&rsquo;s feet, and
saw a shadow streaking among the trees, that
an Indian was after him, was given such a
scare to begin with, and was so chagrined directly
afterward, when he discovered what had
taken place, that his wrath rose in a mighty
storm.</p>
<p>Quilling&rsquo;s yelling at him, instead of pursuing
or shooting at the boy himself directed
Duff&rsquo;s rage toward the former landlord. Paying
no attention to John, he rushed madly up
to Quilling. With the most frightful curses he
called the old fellow &ldquo;a driveling idiot&rdquo; and
worse names, and ended by slapping him full
in the face.</p>
<p>Even this vile insult, however, served only
to make the erstwhile tavern keeper beg the
more piteously for mercy, and try the harder
to excuse himself to the man he feared. Never
was there a more abject coward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Considerably astonished that he was not pursued,
though he heard the epithets Duff rained
upon Quilling, John soon slackened his pace to
a brisk walk, and looked about to get his bearings.
He had lost sight of the trail when approaching
the fallen tree, and in his haste to
flee from the spot when discovery was no longer
to be escaped, he had run in the wrong direction.
The position of the sun, however, and
the mossy bark on the north side of the trees,
aided him in soon finding the right course, and
in due time he reached Neb. Then he remembered
that his shovel had been left in the grave
intended for Ichabod Nesbit, and rode back
for it.</p>
<p>The short afternoon was nearly gone, and it
was likely that at any moment Duff and his two
choice friends would come upon the scene. Still
John resolved to try to complete the work of
burying Nesbit&rsquo;s remains. He stooped and
picked up the shovel.</p>
<p>Bang&mdash;splank! A bullet shattered the handle
of the tool and knocked it from the lad&rsquo;s
hands. At the same instant he saw Duff and
Dexter running toward him, Quilling bringing
up the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>In a trice John was mounted and away amid
the frantic yells of Quilling and the harsh
curses of Duff, and though Dexter took aim at
him, he did not fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the charm&mdash;it&rsquo;s the charm!&rdquo; cried
Quilling tremblingly. &ldquo;Three times that pesky
young rooster has got away from us this day!
It&rsquo;s bad luck&mdash;bad luck to follow him now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John heard the cry as he sped up the hill,
but he knew Duff would ignore it, and feeling
sure that he would be followed clear to the
cabin, sooner or later, he lost no more time in
hurrying toward home. He did not even stop
in the gully to hitch Neb to the abandoned cart,
as he had planned, but hurried by. It was now
so late that he would not reach the cabin until
after dark at best, and to try to thread the uncertain
trail with the cart after darkness came
was out of the question, even should he encounter
no wolves, which animals were not unlikely
to attack him if given half an opportunity after
nightfall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>The sparks pouring out of the great chimney
of the cabin and the light shining through the
chinks here and there, giving promise of a
warm fire and supper awaiting him, were a
most pleasant sight to John as he galloped into
the clearing and across the little valley to his
home, in the early twilight. The night had
come on cold and raw, with every indication
of a considerable snowfall and an end of the
bright days of autumn weather which had extended
into December.</p>
<p>Ree came quickly out of the cabin as he
heard John&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trot along in, old boy, and warm yourself,
I&rsquo;ll look after Neb,&rdquo; he said, wondering why
John had not brought the old cart home, but
waiting for another time to ask questions, for
he knew his chum must be cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Ah, how pleasant it was to be snug and comfortable
and safe once more, and with his mind
chuck-full of interesting things to tell Ree,
thought John, when he had washed his hands
and face and spoken a pleasant word to the
quiet Quaker sitting in a big, easy chair the
boys had rigged up for him, with the half of a
large hollow block of wood for a back. There
was the delicious smell of fresh bear steaks to
sharpen his appetite, too, and a crisp, brown
johnny-cake still smoking hot on the table. A
little bark basket of hickory nuts, to be cracked
afterward as a relish and to help pass the time
pleasantly, was on the rude chimney mantel.
Only one thing marred his happiness. It was
the thought of the awful murder of Black
Eagle and of the Indian&rsquo;s body lying cold and
still in the dark forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I guess it does feel good to be back
again,&rdquo; said John most heartily, in reply to a
remark the Quaker made, and soon Ree came
in and supper was ready at once.</p>
<p>Theodore Hatch was helped up to the table,
easy chair and all, and the two boys seated
themselves on three-legged stools, of their own
manufacture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a heap to tell,&rdquo; said John, brimming
over with anxiety to impart his information,
but giving Ree a wink to signify that he
could not tell all in the presence of the Quaker
without letting the latter know the object of his
journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead; let&rsquo;s hear the whole story,&rdquo; said
Ree. &ldquo;Mr. Hatch knows where you went, and
why. For, you see, he made a discovery to-day,
and then I told him where Ichabod Nesbit was
killed, and that you had gone to give his bones
a respectable burial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gravity of Ree&rsquo;s tone caused John to
ask, with some concern:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A discovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he was robbed at the Eagle tavern of
the half of a letter telling the location of a fortune
hidden in the ground somewhere near
Philadelphia. Now, don&rsquo;t open your eyes so.
We should have guessed as much after seeing
the letter those men, Duff and Dexter, and the
landlord, had. The fact is, Mr. Hatch has not
told his story more than what I have told you,
but waited until you should be here to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell thy own story first, friend. Mine
can wait,&rdquo; the Quaker said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Black Eagle&rsquo;s dead, and Duff and
Dexter killed him. I saw Duff shoot him down.
They might have killed me, but I got away
from them. Quilling, the landlord at the Eagle
tavern, is with them, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really enjoying the sensation he had caused,
John paused and looked at Ree, who was staring
at him in astonishment, and at the Quaker,
who was wringing his hands, greatly distressed,
as he always was when he heard of the
killing of human beings, or of any act of cruelty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor Indian! Father in heaven, forgive
the slayers of so good a man as Black
Eagle!&rdquo; came prayerfully from the Quaker&rsquo;s
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know him&mdash;Black Eagle, I mean?&rdquo;
asked John in some surprise.</p>
<p>The Quaker nodded, and Ree, recovering
from the depths of thought into which his mind
had sunk, quickly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, John, do tell all that happened! Begin
at the time you left here! You saw three
fellows and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait a jiffy,&rdquo; John interrupted. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t see those fellows when I left here, any
such thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ree smiled and allowed his friend to begin
all over again and tell the story in his own way.
This John did to the satisfaction of both his
hearers, when once fairly started, and long before
he had finished they were forgetting their
supper, growing cold before them as they listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those chaps will be here, sooner or later.
We&rsquo;ve got to watch out for them,&rdquo; said Ree
decisively, when John concluded. &ldquo;What a
horrible fellow that Duff is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such greed for gold&mdash;such greed for
gold!&rdquo; murmured Theodore Hatch sorrowfully.
&ldquo;Better, my dear, kind aunt, hadst thou
thrown thy riches and thy jewels to the
flames!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Hatch know we have the half of
the letter which Ichabod Nesbit had?&rdquo; John
asked, in the midst of the questions Ree put to
him, and the exclamation of the Quaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know thou hast the writing, friend. I
know that, and promise me that Duff shall
never have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gentleman&rsquo;s eager earnestness was
most intense. As he spoke he rose partially to
his feet, leaning heavily on the table. His
movement was so sudden, his manner so keenly
earnest, that both Ree and John involuntarily
started back in surprise, the Quaker
bending toward them. As for an instant all
paused in these attitudes, the hickory bark
torch on the mantel and the blaze of the fire
casting a flickering, ruddy glow upon them, a
most dramatic picture was presented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Hatch,&rdquo; said Ree quietly,
hesitating but a moment. &ldquo;Duff shall not have
that portion of the letter which we found. It
is your own, and we shall help you to prevent
his getting it, if he tries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we want to do,&rdquo; said John bluntly,
&ldquo;is to get hold of the part of the letter that
Duff has.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on what Mr. Hatch says,&rdquo;
Ree answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my poor, dear aunt&rsquo;s money. It
was to be Ichabod&rsquo;s and mine. Now Ichabod&rsquo;s
gone, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the money is yours,&rdquo; John put in as
the Quaker hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish very much to get it&mdash;it is all mine&mdash;I
wish I could remember the wording of the
part of the letter stolen from me. Alas, I cannot&mdash;and
the half of the writing which Ichabod
had, and for which I undertook so much, is
now of no use to me. If Mr. Duff comes here,
as you say he may, I shall ask him to give me
the paper they took from my saddle-bags. I
shall insist; for the writing can be of no use to
him without that which goes with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said John, smiling at the
old gentleman&rsquo;s simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell your story now, Mr. Hatch, if you
are not too tired,&rdquo; Ree urged. &ldquo;Yet you must
not over-estimate your strength, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; John quickly added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been wanting for a long time to know about
that hidden treasure, and who hid it, and what
for. Why, Ree and I talked about it many
times, before we knew anything more about it
than was in the letter which Nesbit had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not much of a story,&rdquo; said the Quaker
sadly, as John left the sentence unfinished,
&ldquo;but I will tell thee all I know and should have
told thee long before but wished to be sure that
I could trust thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was when you thought that your half
of the fortune letter was in your saddle-bags,&rdquo;
put in John slyly, while Ree could not but
smile at the odd mixture of cupidity and simplicity
which Mr. Hatch displayed, and his
chum&rsquo;s gentle insinuation that the Quaker
would not trust them until he found his much-prized
letter missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, verily, I thought the letter was in my
saddle-bags, and watched them so closely, fearing
some one would suspect my secret. I could
not endure to have them out of my sight, but
never once did I doubt that the paper was
safely inside the little pocket I had made for it.
And lo, it had been taken out far back at the
Eagle tavern! Verily, it is in heaven that we
should lay up golden treasure, where moth and
rust cannot corrupt. But we must try to obtain
the paper which was taken from me; aye,
we must not fail to do that! Yet there must
be no bloodshed&mdash;no fighting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing how his chance remark had switched
the Quaker from his story, John resolved to
interrupt no more, nor did he. Mr. Hatch&rsquo;s
mind, however, was apparently so divided between
the thought of his loss and the narrative
he was trying to relate that his progress was
tediously slow. Not once did the boys suspect,
however, that he was not telling the absolute
truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>The old gentleman explained to the two
friends that when he first discovered that the
letter had been removed from his saddle-bags,
he suspected them of taking it; but when he
had told Ree that the paper was missing and
the latter at once remembered the writing in
the hands of Duff, Dexter and Quilling at the
Eagle tavern, and the peculiar circumstances
connecting Ichabod Nesbit&rsquo;s name with matter,
and informed him of this, he knew his young
hosts were innocent, and blamed himself harshly
for doubting them.</p>
<p>The Quaker&rsquo;s story was a long one, and may
be summed up substantially as follows:</p>
<p>He and Ichabod Nesbit, he stated, were half-brothers.
Ichabod being the younger by
nearly twenty years, there had never been
much companionship between them, and they
drifted farther and farther apart after the
death of their mother. She had been an English
girl and her first husband, Mr. Hatch&rsquo;s
father, was an Englishman. With the family
lived the mother&rsquo;s sister, whom they called
&ldquo;Aunt Harriet.&rdquo; A good many years after
Mr. Hatch&rsquo;s father died, his mother had been
married a second time to John Nesbit. Of this
union Ichabod was born. At the breaking out
of the Revolutionary war, Ichabod was a wild,
worthless young fellow and left home presumably
to become a soldier, and Theodore Hatch,
having become a Quaker, meanwhile, remained
in Pennsylvania and saw his brother no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Time passed and the mother of the two half-brothers
died. It then developed that property
she had had in her own name had all been spent
by her second husband, now deceased, and by
Ichabod. But her sister, &ldquo;Aunt Harriet,&rdquo; was
still possessed of means, through fortunate investments
in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>However, she was also possessed of a stern,
Loyalist spirit, and though she privately admitted
that King George III. was a &ldquo;sap-head,&rdquo;
in her own language, she strongly insisted
that no matter who or what the king was,
his subjects should be loyal. She resolved to
return to England, and secretly disposed of
her property, though at great sacrifice. She
would not, however, take with her to England
the wealth she had acquired in the Colonies
whose rebel spirit she hated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>What was to be done? She determined to
give all that she left behind to her nephews,
Theodore Hatch and Ichabod Nesbit. But as
both were absent, she hit upon the plan of hiding
her fortune, and then, after writing a careful
description of the location of the hiding
place, cut the writing in two, sending one-half
to one nephew, the other to the other; and
sending to each, also, a long letter explaining
her plan and urging them to be more brotherly&mdash;Ichabod
to be a better man and Theodore to
be more charitable toward him.</p>
<p>To obtain her fortune they would thus be
obliged to meet and put together the two halves
of the written description of the spot where the
money and valuables were secreted, or they
could not find that hiding place. Well pleased
with her novel scheme, the old lady bade the
half-brothers an affectionate farewell in the
letters which she wrote, and at the earliest opportunity
departed for England, never to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Nearly a year passed, the Quaker stated, before
the lawyer to whom the secret letters were
entrusted found Theodore Hatch and delivered
his letter to him. The lawyer knew nothing of
the letter&rsquo;s contents, and when the Quaker inquired
of him concerning Ichabod Nesbit, he
could give no information save that Ichabod
had been in Philadelphia expecting to find his
aunt and get some money; but she was gone,
and he got instead the letter left for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell that pious half-brother o&rsquo;
mine that if he wants to do business with me
he can hunt me up. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to look fer
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the message Ichabod left for the
Quaker, the latter said, but the lawyer, not
knowing what the words meant, gave them no
particular thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HELPING THE DELAWARES&mdash;DANGER.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Thus thou knowest that much time passed
ere I made any effort to find Ichabod,&rdquo; the
Quaker concluded. &ldquo;I did at last hear that he
was living in Connecticut, and had settled
down to peaceable pursuits. So, in the course
of time, I set out to find him, and having no
family and no kin, save Ichabod, I proposed
to give all my time to it. With all my earthly
possessions in my saddle-bags, therefore, I
mounted my dearly beloved mare and set out.
I have been traveling ever since. In time I
learned of Ichabod&rsquo;s death. It was at the
Eagle tavern that I heard of it. Friend Quilling
there knew of the half-letter which Ichabod
had, and knew of what I was in search, as
soon as I inquired for Brother Nesbit. For Mr.
Quilling and Ichabod were very friendly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;I lodged at the Eagle tavern that night and
from there set out to find the Indian, Black
Eagle, and in a few weeks I located him. But
he had taken nothing from the body of Ichabod
Nesbit, for killing whom I took him sharply to
task; for, though Ichabod was no credit to me,
he was yet my half-brother, as I have said.
Having learned from Black Eagle where Ichabod&rsquo;s
body lay, beneath the stones along the
trail at the foot of the hill, near where a giant
tree was shattered by lightning, I went again
to the Eagle tavern to get further information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to know if Ichabod had any family
or other relations of whom I might be ignorant.
I found that he had none. And it was
that night, as I lay at Mr. Quilling&rsquo;s establishment,
that my letter was taken from my saddle-bags,
though they were in my room, and the
greater wonder is that nothing else was stolen.
Not&mdash;not that I have anything of great value
about me! Indeed, no!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>So did the Quaker finish his story, and neither
of the lads who heard it for a moment
thought he had not spoken the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been soon afterward that we
chanced to stop at the Eagle,&rdquo; said Ree, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Quilling, being somewhat of a coward,
and wanting help, took Duff and Dexter into
his confidence, hoping to secure the other half
of the fortune letter. They found Black Eagle
and persuaded him to accompany them into
this wilderness to find Nesbit&rsquo;s body, believing
either that they would reach the spot ahead of
you, Mr. Hatch, or that you would be unable
to find where Nesbit was killed&mdash;at any rate,
that they would get his half of the letter, and,
already having yours, secure the fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, they did not know I was coming to
these desolate wilds,&rdquo; the Quaker answered.
&ldquo;Not that I would intentionally deceive&mdash;oh,
no! but fearing that rough persons along the
road might molest me, should my mission be
known, I caused Friend Quilling to believe
(without staining my lips with lies, however)
that I would be going back to Philadelphia,
which I fervently hope I may yet do. But, oh,
how sadly disfigured! Yet I shall not appear
to disadvantage when my hat is on. That will
cover the disfigurement then. No one will
know my scalp is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when those fellows discovered,&rdquo; said
John, &ldquo;that some one had reached Nesbit&rsquo;s
grave ahead of them, and Duff found out that
Black Eagle had directed you to the place, saying
nothing to them of having done so, he deliberately
killed the Indian. Now, what I was
going to say is just this:&mdash;Duff will kill any
one of us if he gets a chance, if he thinks he
can get hold of that piece of paper by doing
so! What we ought to do is to go straight to
those robbers and compel them to give up the
letter they stole from Mr. Hatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestion gave the Quaker great uneasiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;we must not go near them! We
must keep away from them&mdash;oh dear, oh
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All in all Mr. Hatch was so distressed and it
was now so late, that without more ado, Ree
drew in the latch-string, a signal that it was bed
time.</p>
<p>The hickory bark torch had long since
burned out. The fire was low and the interior
of the cabin almost dark. Confident, therefore,
that no one without would notice his action,
even though watching the cabin, Ree next
opened loop holes on all sides and he and John
carefully looked out.</p>
<p>All was still and calm save for the usual
sounds of animals in the surrounding forest
and the blowing of the wind, swirling fine dry
snow, with which the air was filled in all directions,
even under the door of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ring will wake us up if any one comes
prowling around the cabin,&rdquo; said Ree, &ldquo;and
those chaps won&rsquo;t do more than try to steal
that letter. Moreover, they cannot be sure
that we have it. They naturally suppose that
Mr. Hatch got it, and it is not likely they are
sure he is with us, or that we ever saw him,
even. Their scheme will be to spy around and
learn all they can before they begin to fight.
As for their trying to swear upon us the killing
of Black Eagle, I don&rsquo;t fear that a particle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John acknowledged that Ree&rsquo;s thoughts
were probably correct, and neither lad felt any
alarm as they went to bed; and as for Theodore
Hatch, he was already snoring.</p>
<p>The snow was several inches deep and the
air biting cold when the pioneer boys arose in
the morning, but they welcomed the change for
two reasons: first, it gave them better success in
hunting and trapping, by reason of their being
able to track the game; and in the second place
they would be able, by reason of the snow,
speedily to discover the fact if human prowlers
were about; for there are times when footprints
tell as much as words could do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>It was a matter of regret to both the boys,
however, now that the hunting was so good,
that they could not go together on account of
the necessity of one remaining with Mr. Hatch.
The Quaker was well and strong enough that
he could have been left alone, but he was so
afraid, and there really was such danger that
Duff and his party would visit the cabin, that
the lads deemed it unwise to take any chances.</p>
<p>The absence of the Indians&mdash;the warriors
and hunters&mdash;was noticeable in the success the
young Palefaces had with their traps and
shooting; but it was also no less noticeable in
the lack of business they had as traders, and
to keep their store of furs piling up they
hunted a great deal.</p>
<p>It was not an uncommon thing during the
fine winter days which followed this first hard
snow storm for John to go many miles from
home in quest of game, while Ree devoted the
day to chopping wood and clearing the land
near the cabin, taking his turn at hunting the
next day; but neither boy saw anything of
Duff, Dexter or Quilling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Occasionally wandering Indians came to the
cabin, but they reported, when questioned, that
they had observed no Paleface strangers anywhere
about. So a feeling of greater security
from molestation by either white or red men
came to the occupants of the little log house
beside the river; and about this time, too, a
discovery was made which afforded a new subject
for thought and conversation.</p>
<p>Ree was hunting one day some distance from
home in the direction of the town of the Delawares
upon the lake, and came upon the tracks
of a young bear, which for some reason had
left its winter quarters or had failed to find
any. He followed the trail of the cub to a large
oak, and discovered the animal quietly resting
in a fork of the tree, twenty feet from the
ground. At one shot he brought the bear
down, and, securing the pelt, it occurred to
him to take the best portions of the meat to the
Delaware town as a good-will offering to the
old men and squaws there. He would inquire
what had been heard of Captain Pipe, and
might also get news of Duff&rsquo;s party, or of the
lone Indian, who had not been seen for a long
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Within an hour of the time the thought came
to him, Ree was at the Delaware village. He
could not but notice how lonely an air it had.
Even the dogs seemed not to bark so vigorously
as usual, but sniffed hungrily, leaping
up at the bear meat upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, neighbors and friends,&rdquo; called Ree,
as the noise of the dogs brought the Indians,
Gentle Maiden among the rest, from the cabins,
and stepping up to the daughter of Captain
Pipe, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentle Maiden, I shot a young bear near by,
and I have brought some fresh meat for you
and your people, if you care for it; and if you
do not, the dogs may be glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a graceful courtesy, which may have
been all her own, or taught her, more likely, by
the Moravian missionaries, of whom, as a
child, she had learned to speak English, the Indian
girl accepted the gift, saying most earnestly,
as the other Indians, half clad, wrapped
in skins and worn blankets, crowded near:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Truly the Great Spirit has sent you&mdash;the
Great Spirit of the Red Children of the forests,
or the God of the Palefaces&mdash;has sent you and
this food. For days and nights&mdash;more than
on the fingers of both my hands could be told&mdash;my
father&rsquo;s people have had no meat&mdash;only
the flesh of the dogs we killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ree would have interrupted the girl to tell
his regret that he and John had not known
their needs to have helped them before, but
she would not permit it; for Gentle Maiden,
now really a young woman, though girlish in
appearance in her short skirt and embroidered
leggins, continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little corn have we left, and of beans
none; and no powder here for the one gun left
with us by my father&rsquo;s warriors. Yet come,
rest, and eat of what we have and our people
shall prepare more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Giving the bear meat to some squaws to be
quickly cooked, Gentle Maiden and her mother
led the way to the cabin of Captain Pipe, somewhat
better than the others, though poor
enough and now half filled with smoke from
the fire built in the center of the earthen floor,
beneath a hole in the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped to find Chief Hopocon (Captain
Pipe) back from his fighting expedition,&rdquo;
said Ree, pretending to eat of the scanty quantity
of parched corn placed before him, for
hospitality&rsquo;s sake, a courtesy the Indians never
forgot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the fighting may not be over. There
may be another great battle,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another battle?&rdquo; the boy ejaculated. &ldquo;Has
there been one, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the white brother not heard?&mdash;a great
battle, in which my father&rsquo;s warriors and many
more drove the soldiers of the Long-knives
even as scared birds before a mighty storm,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the mind of Gentle Maiden to complete
the sentence by saying, &ldquo;and took many,
many scalps,&rdquo; but she wished to spare the
white boy&rsquo;s feelings, and hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo; Ree questioned,
quickly guessing the words left unsaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A runner came to tell of the mighty battle
and to call all the people to be ready to drive
every Paleface from our lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more of the battle,&rdquo; Ree said, quietly.
&ldquo;Was it long ago? And where was the
fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; answered Gentle Maiden in a
hushed but still slightly triumphant tone,
pointing to the westward, &ldquo;a journey of seven
suns, it may be, near the river called Wabash.
The Paleface chief Sain Clair (General St.
Clair) and many soldiers had come into the
land of my father&rsquo;s people and his friends to
build their forts and to drive the Indians from
their homes. It was at the coming of day that
the battle began and the white soldiers and the
warriors were many as the trees of the forest.
Hard and long was the fighting, but before the
sun was in the middle of the sky our warriors
had conquered&mdash;our warriors had driven the
white chief Sain Clair and all the soldiers from
their camps, and they fled before my father&rsquo;s
people even as leaves when the winds blow
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were many killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ree asked the question calmly, though he
could hardly restrain his feelings or keep from
showing the resentment in his heart that the
Indian girl should seem to boast of the victory
over the white men. And yet he knew that the
savages had been abused and imposed upon.
He knew that their children were taught to
look upon the whites as their enemies and as
people of &ldquo;two tongues,&rdquo; who would deceive
and cheat and steal. Especially was this true
in this land of the Ohio, where the awful massacre
of nearly a hundred peaceable Indians
by white soldiers was still fresh in the minds
of the savages.</p>
<p>Gentle Maiden did not at once answer the
question, for in her heart she felt that Ree, who
had been her father&rsquo;s friend, was angered by
the news she told him and by her tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Many will rise only in the spirit world,&rdquo;
she said at last, &ldquo;many Palefaces and many
warriors. Never has my father told me of any
battle where the ground was so covered by the
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad, Gentle Maiden,&rdquo; the white
boy returned thoughtfully, and then, thinking
suddenly of that unknown, lone Indian of
whom he had seen or heard nothing for some
time, he remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Indian who has been fighting
the white men alone in these forests here was
also in the battle. I have not seen him for a
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not in the battle, but a new scalp
hangs at his belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him? Has he been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not been here. The runner I told
you of saw him; and a white hunter lies dead
by the stream named the White Woman. It is
his own battle the red brother fights, and he
will go to war in no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he, Gentle Maiden?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father, Chief Hopocon, may tell you.
He is not of my father&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that further questioning would be
useless, Ree said no more about that matter,
but sought to ascertain to what extent his aid
and John&rsquo;s would be acceptable in furnishing
meat for the people still remaining in the Delaware
village. He quickly found that, whatever
her feelings toward the Palefaces in general
might be, the daughter of Captain Pipe
looked upon himself and his friend in quite a
different way, and she gladly heard his suggestion
that, as they killed more game than
they needed for themselves, he would see to it
that the Delawares should not want.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>This suggestion cost Ree considerable discomfort
of mind, notwithstanding, and he was
by no means certain that John would welcome
the proposition after he had heard of the battle
of which the girl told (the defeat of St.
Clair, Nov. 4, 1791). And indeed it did seem to
Ree himself almost unbearable to consider that
he and John should be furnishing food to the
helpless members of Captain Pipe&rsquo;s village,
while that honest but cruel and defiant chieftain
and his braves were making war on the whites&mdash;his
own people; also that they should be giving
assistance to those who upheld the mysterious
lone Indian in his secret, sneaking attacks upon
solitary hunters and travelers. But he bade
Gentle Maiden and the other Indians who came
to see him off, a friendly farewell, and set out
for home, thinking deeply of all he had heard.</p>
<p>The thought would come to him that he and
John were bound to have trouble; for, though
they might retain the friendship and good will
of Captain Pipe, it was more than probable that
he would be unable to restrain his warriors,
and especially the warriors of other tribes, the
Wyandots, Senecas and, most of all, the Mingoes,
from making a bold attack upon them,
now that their blood was heated by a deeper
hate and their minds inflamed by the victory
they had won. So, wearily, Ree plodded
through the snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BANDS OF BLACK.</span></h2>
<p>A bitterly cold night was closing in when Ree
reached the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather guess there will be no prowlers
around this evening,&rdquo; he remarked, as he
shook the snow from his coonskin cap in front
of the roaring fireplace, and held his hands to
the blaze to warm them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ree,&rdquo; said John, ignoring the remark,
&ldquo;Mr. Hatch wants a feather bed. We were
talking about it as you came in. I told him we
could make him one from turkey feathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we can,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin
saving feathers right away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is because I have decided to remain here
until I can go in quest of the rascals who have
the missing part of my aunt&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; the
Quaker put in, very seriously. &ldquo;For poor
Ichabod is dead&mdash;dead and gone&mdash;and the
money, lads, is mine&mdash;all mine. Oh, I must
obtain the paper which was stolen from me!
All mine&mdash;the money and all&mdash;it is all mine,&rdquo;
he murmured, and from time to time repeated&mdash;&ldquo;All
mine&mdash;all mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much thinking of the hidden treasure and his
assertion that he was the only creature known
to be alive who had any valid claim to the fortune,
seemed fast to be making Theodore Hatch
a covetous, disagreeable old man. He had
changed wonderfully in the short time since the
boys had known him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt stay as long as we do, if thou
likest, friend,&rdquo; said Ree, adopting the Quaker
manner of speaking. &ldquo;But the Indians have
fought a great battle near the Wabash river and
sadly defeated General St. Clair and his troops.
What the result will be as concerns ourselves,
we must wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; John exclaimed.</p>
<p>All that he had learned from Gentle Maiden,
Ree then told his friends, and he told them also
of the destitute circumstances in which he found
the people still remaining in Captain Pipe&rsquo;s village.</p>
<p>There arose in John&rsquo;s mind at once the same
question that had perplexed Ree&mdash;should they
help these needy Indians, while those who ought
to be at home providing for them were fighting
the white troops and, no doubt, killing settlers
and plundering and burning their cabins?</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, we can&rsquo;t let the poor Redskins
starve,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I said to myself on the way
home,&rdquo; Ree replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Theodore Hatch had risen and was walking
up and down the one tiny room of the cabin,
despondent and deeply sorrowing, as was usual
with him when he heard news of bloodshed. He
spoke no word, but at last, still deep in thought,
laid himself down upon his bed and buried his
face in the coarse pillow formed in part by his
closely-watched saddle bags. His position had
not changed when the two boys were ready to
go to bed, and, thinking he slept, they covered
him over with a blanket and bearskin.</p>
<p>All night the wind howled through the valley
of the Cuyahoga, bending the strongest limbs of
the forest trees and snapping dead branches
off short with a sudden crackling which added
to the threatening noises all about. All night
the snow went flying before the gale, piling
itself in drifts upon the log doorstep of the lonely
cabin, against every fallen tree and against
every rock and bluff for miles around,&mdash;in the
haunted spot where the sunken eyes of the dead
Black Eagle stared upward through their mantle
of white, and beside the smoky hut where
Gentle Maiden knelt before the fire and besought
the Great Spirit to send aid to her
father&rsquo;s people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>All night the storm raged and even the dismal
voices of the wolves were stilled and they slunk
into their cavern homes; so much the safer were
the timid deer seeking shelter among the low-boughed
trees of the ravines. All night the
troubled Quaker lay face downward upon his
bed, his mind struggling between his love for
gold and his wish to do right. On their own
bed in the corner, Return Kingdom and John
Jerome soundly slept or, partially awakened
from time to time by the fierceness of the tempest,
dreamed the hours away.</p>
<p>The coming of morning showed the hours of
darkness to have been very busy ones for the
storm king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we will not be venturing far from
the cabin to-day,&rdquo; said John, looking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky there is no need of doing so,&rdquo; Ree
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear friends&rdquo;&mdash;it was the Quaker who
spoke, and his voice was strangely soft and low,
reminding the boys at once of the caressing way
in which he always addressed his mare, Ph&oelig;be&mdash;&ldquo;whatever
the depth of snow or the cold, I
am going to the town of the Delawares to carry
them whatever food thee will spare me for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you mustn&rsquo;t think of doing so, Mr.
Hatch,&rdquo; said Ree. &ldquo;I do not believe the Indians
are really suffering, as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need food, and more than food for
their bodies merely,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;They
are but ignorant savages, but bravely they are
bearing all the suffering which comes to them
because their strong men have gone forth to
fight for what they righteously believe to be
their own; and I shall go among them, and even
as our illustrious William Penn would do were
he alive and here, I shall both feed and teach
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some great change had come over Theodore
Hatch. But the day before he would have
shown but little interest in any subject save that
of the hidden fortune. Now he did not mention
it, but bundled up and visited the log stable adjoining
the cabin to tell Ph&oelig;be his plans, as he
had so often told the gentle animal of the treasure,
saying over and over again, &ldquo;All mine&mdash;all
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The depth of the snow was so great and the
way so difficult that, finding the Quaker determined
to follow out the plan he had formed, the
two boys agreed that Ree should accompany
him, mounted on Neb, while Mr. Hatch rode his
own horse. With a generous supply of provisions,
therefore, the two set out, leaving John
alone to guard the cabin and the Quaker&rsquo;s
prized saddle bags, and to cut and store near
the house a stock of wood for the fireplace.</p>
<p>Well-nigh buried beneath the snow, Ree and
his companion found the village of the Delawares
a desolate place indeed, upon their arrival
there after nearly three hours of floundering
through great drifts and over fallen trees
and brush, the trail being so hidden by its spotless
cloak that to follow it closely was quite impossible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>The meat the white men carried to the Indians,
however, was really badly needed. It
became evident at once that the whole truth had
not been revealed to Ree by Gentle Maiden&mdash;because
of her pride, perhaps&mdash;and several of
the oldest and most feeble of the Indian men
and women were genuinely sick solely for want
of food. The children, too, though bearing their
suffering with true Indian grit,&mdash;not a cry or
whimper escaping them,&mdash;were most desperately
hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dogs knew our distress and their danger,
and our women could not come near to them
to kill one for eating. Always did they run
away, howling or sometimes almost speaking
words of fear&mdash;or&mdash;or woe,&rdquo; said Gentle
Maiden, telling of the suffering of her father&rsquo;s
people, while Ree and Mr. Hatch warmed themselves
at the fire in the chief&rsquo;s cabin. At the
same time the girl&rsquo;s mother was carrying more
wood to make a brighter blaze, and the hungry
Delawares were feeding themselves ravenously
in their own cabins or beside a fire built near
the center of the space the irregular collection
of huts enclosed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thy father will not travel far through snow
so deep,&rdquo; the Quaker said in answer. &ldquo;He and
his fighting men will be slow in reaching home,
therefore. Yet, young friend, I shall come
among thee with food for thee and thine until
he shall return. Is it true that thou wert taught
by the Moravian preachers, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missionaries trained my tongue to
speak the language of the Palefaces. They were
very kind. Still their God is not the god of
the Indians, my father says. My father has
lived long. He knows much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quick intuition of the girl in recognizing
the Quaker as one who would wish to teach the
Delawares the religion of the white people, and
her way of telling him that his efforts would
meet with poor appreciation, amused Ree,
though he sincerely wished his friend all
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, thy Father in heaven is all wise
and approves the love thou bearest thy earthly
father. Goodness is in thy heart, and&mdash;see,
though one of thy own people, it may be, has
done this, yet do I come to thee as a friend who
seeks only to do thee good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>As he spoke, the Quaker bent down and
pointed to the scalpless top of his head. With
scarcely a tremor Gentle Maiden followed his
words and action and realized at once what he
had undergone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, verily, my head was cut thus, and I was
left for dead, but forgiveness is in my heart,&rdquo;
the Quaker said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s people did not that,&rdquo; said the
girl, with somewhat of haughtiness in her voice.
&ldquo;The Paleface brother was shot by one who
roams far and alone. He is not of my father&rsquo;s
tribe. His war is his own war. He comes and
goes&mdash;now here&mdash;now far&mdash;much far off. On
his arm he marks with paint one band of black
for every Paleface killed. Many bands are on
his arm. Many Palefaces he has killed. Never
will his war be ended. He must not know my
Paleface preacher brother, that he thinks he
killed, still lives. Yet it is his war. Gentle
Maiden may not speak more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Theodore Hatch was considerably puzzled by
the girl&rsquo;s speech; but Ree, quickly understanding
her, explained to him that for each person
he killed the prowling Indian, whoever he might
be, pricked in black a circlet about his arm, in
addition to taking the scalp; that for some reason
he would never cease his attacks upon the
whites, and that if he discovered that one man,
whom he supposed he had killed, was still alive,
he would seek to make that man&rsquo;s death certain,
or kill some other man instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young Paleface speaks well. Gentle
Maiden cannot tell so many words of English
now as when her tongue was trained to speak
them,&rdquo; the Indian girl said, confirming Ree&rsquo;s
explanation of her warning to the Quaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see him and reason with him. It is
wrong that his heart should be set against all
white people, though many may have misused
him. Where shall I find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He comes and goes. He is not of the Delawares.
His war is his own war. I have spoken,&rdquo;
the girl made answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to have Gentle Maiden tell me of this
lone Indian myself, but the Delawares will not
say who he is,&rdquo; said Ree, fearing the Quaker
might give offense by pressing the maiden to
tell more than she was willing to do. &ldquo;He is
not a Delaware, yet Captain Pipe believes he has
some just cause for making war on the whites,
secretly and alone, and does not attempt to stop
him. Am I right, Gentle Maiden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl nodded her head and said
simply, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation turned to other subjects,
both Mr. Hatch and Ree being anxious to learn
to what extent the people of the village would
need assistance during the winter, in case Captain
Pipe should not return. It quickly became
apparent that the Indians would require a great
deal of aid. They had almost nothing left to
eat, and every cache (holes in the earth in which
corn or other provisions were hidden) had been
emptied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>The prospect that on the white neighbors of
the savages would fall the task of providing
them with meat was not, to Ree, a pleasing one.
True, it was a duty and must be performed, but
it would take the time of himself or John the
greater part of every day, he quickly saw. The
Quaker was undoubtedly willing to do his part,
but his mind was bent more upon the spiritual
than the bodily welfare of the Indians, and,
moreover, he would scarcely shoot a deer even
if he had an opportunity.</p>
<p>Promising to return in a day or two, Ree and
Mr. Hatch took their leave, mounted their
horses and started homeward. The wind was
still blowing in sudden gusts and was bitterly
cold. The trail through the snow, made in
reaching the Indian town, however, rendered
the return journey easier, and good progress
was being made when, as the two rode along the
edge of a high bluff between the village and
their cabin, a strong wind caught the broad
brim of the Quaker&rsquo;s hat and sent it sailing
over the edge of the steep hillside, into the
gully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it for you,&rdquo; said Ree, who was considerably
in advance of his companion, and,
reaching a place where the descent was less
precipitous, he rode into the ravine, then back
to a point even with that where Mr. Hatch had
paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>An odd picture the Quaker presented as he
sat astride his mare, leaning slightly forward,
his uncovered, scalpless head exposed to the
wind, while he held out his arm pointing to the
spot where his beaver lay.</p>
<p>Ree glanced up to note the direction which
the outstretched finger indicated. Almost at
the same moment a terrific shriek sounded high
and loud above the roaring wind, followed by
another and another.</p>
<p>In an instant Ree&rsquo;s rifle was at his shoulder.
No sign of any living creature could be seen,
however, save Theodore Hatch sitting bolt upright
in his saddle staring in vacant astonishment
across the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake, what is it?&rdquo; eagerly
cried the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, I think it was the young Indian who
tried to kill me&mdash;who has my scalp,&rdquo; muttered
Mr. Hatch, in tones of awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>With all haste Ree recovered the Quaker&rsquo;s
hat and made speed to reach his side. But the
Indian had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went so very suddenly I scarcely saw
him,&rdquo; the Quaker explained. &ldquo;I only heard
him scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meaning of it all came to Ree&rsquo;s mind like
a flash. The lone Indian, prowling along the
opposite side of the ravine, had been attracted
by the noise of their horses, and slipped up to
find what was to be seen. He had come just in
time to discover the Quaker in a ghost-like attitude,
pointing into the valley meaningly, while
his scalped crown and rigid quiet added to the
supernatural appearance he made. Recognizing
the horse and the rider, the latter a man
whose scalp was even then fastened to his own
belt, the Indian had been terrified beyond measure&mdash;thinking
he saw a ghost&mdash;the ghost of one
of his victims.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be greatly mistaken if he does not
follow us to find out just exactly what he did
see,&rdquo; said Ree, explaining his supposition concerning
the Indian&rsquo;s fright. &ldquo;There is no doubt
but what he is watching from a distance at this
very minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ree was right. The lone Indian did follow
at a respectful distance, and the fact that
he did so was a fortunate thing for the young
pioneers, as they afterward discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A CRY FROM THE DARKNESS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad you&rsquo;re home,&rdquo; was John&rsquo;s
greeting as Ree and Mr. Hatch dismounted before
the door. &ldquo;There has been somebody
prowling around the woods across the clearing,
and it worried me. Honest truth, I believe it
was that man Duff, though he looked like an
Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an Indian, all right,&rdquo; Ree confidently
answered, &ldquo;our old friend, the vanisher. We,
also, saw him, or rather, heard him, and I guess
he was more scared than we were, wasn&rsquo;t he,
Mr. Hatch?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, I was much frightened myself,&rdquo; the
Quaker answered, and then Ree told all about
the experience beside the ravine.</p>
<p>John could not be certain that the person he
had seen was not the lone Indian. It was during
the afternoon, he said, that he noticed a
movement among the bushes on the hillside
across the clearing, and watching more closely,
had made certain that some one was spying on
him and the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It made me so nervous that I got to thinking
maybe some one was slipping up behind me, or
maybe some one would get into the shanty while
my back was turned, and all of a sudden I found
myself as scared as I could be, and I jumped
into the house and shut the door, almost sure
that I was going to be killed the very next second.
Ring clawed at the door a full minute
before I could gather up my courage, and
laughing because I felt myself so frightened,
opened the door for him to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was your imagination that got away with
you,&rdquo; said Ree, smiling. &ldquo;If a chap just imagines
that some one is watching him, waiting to
shoot or grab him, he can scare himself worse
than he would be if he really saw some one just
ready to jump onto him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation turned to other subjects
then, the boys having agreed that as the wind
and snow would by this time have covered up
the tracks the prowler made, it would be of no
use to try to find them and so determine who
the fellow was. It was already dark, moreover,
and so stormy a night that neither boy cared to
leave the bright fireplace unless it were necessary.</p>
<p>Supper was over and Ree and John and Mr.
Hatch, snug and comfortable, were discussing
the situation of the Delawares when to their
astonishment there came a knocking at the door.
In all the time since the cabin was built no visitor
had announced his presence in that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns! Who can it be?&rdquo; murmured
John, but Ree hastily arose to answer the call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; came the latter&rsquo;s voice
cheerily, as the figure of a man crouching close
to the wall, as if to escape the raw, cold wind,
was revealed by the firelight when the door was
opened.</p>
<p>Softly the person glided into the room and
close to the fire, spreading out his hands to the
welcome heat, but turning his face away as if
the bright glare hurt his eyes. His dress and
long black hair and tawny skin indicated that he
was an Indian, probably of the Mohawk tribe&mdash;a
Mingo, at least&mdash;but neither of the boys remembered
having seen him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a cold night,&rdquo; said John, hospitably
moving back from the fire to give the visitor
more room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger uttered no other word, but, Indian
fashion, shrugged his shoulders as if to
answer that there was no doubt as to the truth
of the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you traveled far?&rdquo; John asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heap,&rdquo; the fellow answered, glancing
around to note where Ree was placing the rifle
he had put in the boy&rsquo;s hands as a sign of
friendship, upon entering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get our friend some meat, John,&rdquo; said Ree,
standing the rifle in a corner. &ldquo;Sit down and
warm yourself,&rdquo; he next said, addressing the
mysterious caller, pushing a stool toward him.</p>
<p>The fellow seated himself, but still turned his
face away, even while eating the cold venison
which John placed on another stool beside him.
Again John tried to get him to talk, but he answered
only in the briefest way, and said nothing
except when directly spoken to. Of his own
accord a little later, however, he did speak, saying:
&ldquo;Me good Injun; me sleep here,&rdquo; pointing
to the floor near the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may sleep there,&rdquo; said Ree, but
behind the visitor&rsquo;s back he gave John a look
which said, &ldquo;We must watch this chap,&rdquo; and
his chum winked and nodded.</p>
<p>Theodore Hatch seemed quite undisturbed by
the presence of the unexpected guest, but continued
to talk to the boys of his plans for teaching
and caring for the Indians at Captain
Pipe&rsquo;s town. Then he drifted from that subject
to wondering whether the missing part of
the paper describing the hiding place of his
aunt&rsquo;s fortune would ever fall into his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of one thing we must make sure,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the letter must never come into the possession
of the scoundrels who robbed me. I shall never
use&mdash;verily if I am to work as a missionary
among these poor Indians,&mdash;I shall never need,
the money my poor mother&rsquo;s sister secreted for
my unfortunate brother and myself; yet shall
it remain hidden rather than that it should be
found and gambled away and spent for rum by
the wicked men who have tried to obtain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heap tired&mdash;Injun heap tired,&rdquo; said the
strange creature still toasting his hands close
to the fire, though it was now so warm that the
others had moved back from the blaze, and John
was even lying on the bed of skins and blankets
in the farthest corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, strange friend, lie down and rest thyself,&rdquo;
answered the Quaker complacently, taking
a large bearskin from his own bed, and
handing it to the fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Without a word the latter wrapped the robe
about his head and shoulders and threw himself
in a corner&mdash;the very corner in which Ree
had put his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, am weary,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatch, and removing
his coat and boots he lay down on his
own bed and was soon snoring.</p>
<p>Still Ree sat thinking, and John hummed a
tune softly to himself as he lay restfully on his
back, carelessly wondering whether their visitor
spoke the truth when he said, &ldquo;Me good Injun.&rdquo;
All the fear he had felt during the afternoon
was forgotten. As usual he was trusting
to Ree to see that precautions were taken
and that no harm came to them. In the corner
the man under the bearskin seemed sound
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ree and John leaped to their feet together.
Sharp and clear above the rattle and roar of the
nightwind came the report of a rifle, fired at
no great distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Don&rsquo;t open the door!&rdquo; John called,
as his more fearless chum sprang forward to
look out.</p>
<p>The words came too late. In a trice Ree had
the door swung wide and was peering into the
gloom, shading his eyes with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of a white man, borne on the
wind clearly and distinctly, out of the darkness
from the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who-o-o!&mdash;who-o who-oo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if a giant owl were calling from the blackness
of the storm, came these further cries, but
in the sounds there was something strangely
like a human voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Ree, don&rsquo;t stand in the
open door that way! You&rsquo;ll be killed,&rdquo; cried
John, drawing his friend away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you! This way&mdash;this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were Ree&rsquo;s words and he yelled them
at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your gun, John, we must find out who
that is,&rdquo; he hurriedly said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Even as he spoke, and before John could
close the door, a heavy figure leaped between
them from behind, dodged sidewise out of the
light, and in a moment vanished. It was the
mysterious visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt, there! Stand, or I&rsquo;ll put a bullet
through you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Ree who called, but he spoke too late.
His words received not the slightest attention,
and in another second John succeeded in slamming
the door tightly shut, while Theodore
Hatch, awake but decidedly bewildered, sat up
in bed and stared vacantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John dropped almost helplessly upon a stool,
completely mystified and not a little alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to find out,&rdquo; said Ree, his lips
compressed in determination. &ldquo;Do you want to
go out with me to look around?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, look a-here, Ree, we better see
what we can make of this business before ever
you put your foot out of the door! It looks a
lot to me as though some one had set a trap for
us. That owl&rsquo;s hooting was a man&rsquo;s voice as
plain as anything I ever heard. And that chap
who was in here may have been an Indian, but
he was not a &lsquo;good Injun,&rsquo; as he said, by a long
sight; so be reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means be careful,&rdquo; Ree smiled, examining
his rifle and slipping a pistol into his
belt. &ldquo;It is a mighty queer affair, and the
meaning of it is what I want to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, I believe it means robbery,&rdquo; spoke
up Theodore Hatch, tenderly rubbing the scalpless
crown of his head, as if that would help him
to recollect his scattered thoughts. &ldquo;The Indian
tried to seize my saddle bags from under
my head, before he jumped through the door.
I had just wakened up, and scarcely knowing
what I was doing, I let fly my fist at him and
struck him quite a severe blow, I fear, just below
the ear. I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duff!&rdquo; interrupted Return Kingdom, and
into the one word he put so much force and expression
that it spoke volumes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honest truth, Ree, that was what I thought
from the first, but I could not understand how
he could disguise himself so well. He kept his
face away from me, but I had one good look
at him. The paint must have hid his smallpox
marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to say that I think&mdash;and hope,
indeed, that he was not much hurt,&rdquo; the Quaker
went on, just a little impatient that he had been
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that fellow Duff, beyond a doubt,&rdquo;
said Ree. &ldquo;He expected to get your saddle
bags, thinking he would find the half of the cut-in-two
letter in them. Somehow or other his
game was spoiled. Those cries of help were
genuine&mdash;no shamming about them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world did that hooting like an
owl mean then?&rdquo; demanded John. &ldquo;I think
the game was that Dexter or that miserable
Quilling or both of them were stationed outside
to fire a gun and attract our attention. Duff
believed that we would then run out to see what
was wrong, and he, having got inside by playing
the Indian, would then get that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were right, old boy, in one thing,
and that is that there is no reason why we
should go out and hunt them up to-night. We
will just stay quietly inside and one of us must
keep an eye open for their coming back. My,
how the wind howls! I really pity those poor
chaps, that they are out in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity your grandmother!&rdquo; ejaculated John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a world of wickedness it is,&rdquo; sighed
Theodore Hatch, dolefully shaking his head and
rubbing his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and John go to sleep now, Mr. Hatch.
There will be no further trouble, I guess,&rdquo; Ree
said to the old man kindly, after some further
talk, and as the Quaker did lie down, John
stretched himself on his own bed, having first
buckled on a pistol and placed his rifle within
reach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>The exciting incident gave Ree plenty to
think about as he gazed keenly through a loop
hole, vainly trying to catch sight of some spark
of fire or other sign which would show him the
whereabouts of the men who had so unexpectedly
appeared in the vicinity. The snow-filled
air and thick darkness prevented his seeing anything,
however, and the shrieking wind was the
only sound which came to him.</p>
<p>John fell asleep at last and Ree did not disturb
him until at the first peep of daylight when
he went into the shed to care for the two
horses, first calling to his chum to get breakfast
started.</p>
<p>The wind had gone down with the coming of
dawn, but the snow was deep in all directions
and the weather was more intensely cold than
on the previous day. This, however, did not
deter the young pioneers from starting out on
a short tour of investigation as soon as the
morning meal was over. And Theodore Hatch
cautioned them as they set out to use gentle
means rather than force, with any one they met.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Not a trace of the footprints of the mysterious
visitor of the night before were to be seen.
The wind and snow had covered the tracks completely.
With the spirit of true woodsmen, notwithstanding,
the lads made for that point at
the edge of the timber from which they believed
the call for help had come. Even in the woods
they found nothing. The snow was over their
knees on a level and in many places the drifts
were almost impassable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use floundering around this way.
Let&rsquo;s go home and get our snowshoes,&rdquo; Ree
suggested, and John needed no urging. They
turned and passed out of the edge of the woods
a little to the right of the point at which they
had entered. A hundred feet from the timber
Ree paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I struck my foot against something&mdash;something
like the body of a bear, or a
wolf, maybe,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Froze to death,&rdquo; John, who was a few yards
in advance, answered carelessly, not looking
back, thinking it must be some sick or wounded
wolf that had perished in the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered, is more like it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Ree&rsquo;s voice was not raised above his ordinary
tone, but the deep significance of his remark
caused his companion to turn quickly around.
The next instant he was ploughing through the
drifts at a run to where Ree stood, bending
over something in the snow.</p>
<p>It was the body of Quilling, late landlord of
the Eagle tavern. In his still open eyes was a
look of abject terror, and a cry of pain and fear
seemed to have stopped half uttered on his lips.
From his head the scalp was missing, and
where his hat still lay, and under the body, the
snow was red with blood.</p>
<p>The crimson stain upon his clothing near the
left shoulder told the manner of his death. A
bullet had found his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CAPTURED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I can tell whose work this is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an awed, half-frightened tone, as he
looked upon the terrible scene, John spoke.</p>
<p>Ree was already on his knees in the snow trying
to learn if there was not some spark of life
remaining. There was none. The body was
cold and in places the flesh was frozen hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lone Indian&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he slowly answered
John&rsquo;s remark. &ldquo;Poor Quilling. The only
wonder is that the wolves have not been here before
us. It was Quilling who cried out for help,
last night, John.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we will never know just what did
happen, but it looks more and more as if a trap
of some kind had been laid for us, now doesn&rsquo;t
it? And while Quilling and Dexter waited, perhaps,
that prowling Redskin shot him. I only
wish it had been Duff who was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As though they had talked the matter all
over and agreed what they should do, though
scarcely a word was spoken, the boys tramped
up the hill to their cabin. With an axe and
shovel they returned to where the body of
Quilling lay. At the foot of a beech tree which
they proposed to save, as the clearing of their
land progressed, they laboriously dug a shallow
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather Mr. Hatch should know
nothing about this, he is always so broken up by
such things,&rdquo; Ree said thoughtfully, as he
leaned on his shovel, &ldquo;but it does seem a pity
to bury the poor fellow without a prayer or
anything. Shall we tell the Quaker?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>A suggestion from Ree was sufficient always,
for John. Theodore Hatch was informed of
what had taken place. With tears in his eyes
he repeated a few solemn words of the scriptures
and bowed his head in silent prayer.</p>
<p>Deeply impressed, and on the verge of breaking
out in sobs, though this man whose clay they
buried, that wild animals might not tear the
body to pieces, had been their enemy, the brave
boys who performed for him the last deed of
kindliness they could upon this earth, filled in
the frozen mold around and above the corpse.
So passed from the sight of men, far in the forest&rsquo;s
fastnesses, all that was mortal of Henry
Quilling, and the ploughshares of later days
have long since mingled his dust with the soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is another warning to us to watch out for
that sneaking savage,&rdquo; John remarked for the
fourth or fifth time as the three returned slowly
to the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not forget our Delaware friends,&rdquo;
spoke Ree more briskly, hoping to turn the
thoughts of the Quaker in a new channel; for
the old gentleman was deeply depressed by what
had occurred. &ldquo;Do you think we better pay
them another visit to-day, Mr. Hatch?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, it is a sad business,&rdquo; said the
Quaker, &ldquo;but our first duty always must be to
the living. Yea, we must go to the Delawares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was agreed, John, however, taking
Ree&rsquo;s place in the journey.</p>
<p>The Quaker and Ree had had trouble, indeed,
the day before, in getting through the drifted
snow to the Delaware town, but he and John
had still more difficulty this day, for the snow
was deeper and the great banks were in many
places breast high against their horses. And
such was the old gentleman&rsquo;s solicitude for his
mare that, as they toiled slowly along, he more
than once would have turned back, had not the
dapple-gray shown a perfect willingness to bear
him through the very deepest drifts to the best
of its ability. John, mounted on Neb, fell behind,
and let the Quaker&rsquo;s horse break the path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the difference in the strength, but
in the intelligence of the beasts,&rdquo; was the comment
Mr. Hatch made. &ldquo;Thy horse is stronger
than my own, but Ph&oelig;be understands precisely
what is desired of her&mdash;sweet Ph&oelig;be,&rdquo; and he
patted the mare&rsquo;s shoulder lovingly.</p>
<p>The Indian town was reached at last and
John shook hands with Gentle Maiden cordially
as though she were an old and very dear friend.
She had not seen him for long and though, according
to the Indian custom, she showed no
surprise or especial pleasure at the meeting,
it was easily seen that she was pleased.</p>
<p>Still, when the girl engaged in conversation
with the Quaker, John left them and picked his
way through the snow to different huts of the
village, rallying the boys and girls with a smile
and a pleasant word and giving even the old
squaws to understand that he felt perfectly at
home among them. Seeing a bow and arrows
hanging on a forked pole in one of the bark
cabins, John took them down and called to an
Indian lad, ten or twelve years of age, to show
him how well he could shoot. The bow was
about four and a half feet in length, and made
of seasoned hickory, about an inch in thickness
at the middle and a quarter of an inch or less,
the narrow way, near the ends. About the parts
where the greatest strain came on the bow at
either side of the center, the wood was tightly
wound with strong strips of deer or some other
skin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>John had often seen the bows and arrows of
the Indians, though most of the savages were
now supplied with firearms, but he examined
this bow very carefully. The arrows, too, he
looked at with critical eyes, really surprised to
note how cleverly they were made. The shaft
of each was light but strong and straight,
nearly, if not quite, three feet in length. In the
larger and heavier end, arrow heads, or points,
of varying size, laboriously chipped out in flint,
were fastened by splitting the shaft and binding
the flint tightly in the opening so made with
fine, strong cords of rawhide. Similarly a
feather, or in some cases two or three feathers,
were fastened at the small end of the shaft to
make the arrow fly true to the archer&rsquo;s aim. The
bow and especially the arrows, with their sharp,
heavy points, were such dangerous looking
weapons that John inquired of the Indian boy,
partly in Delaware, partly in English:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you not kill turkeys or deer with the
bow, since your warriors are away and your
people have no meat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shoot bows more&mdash;shoot guns,&rdquo; the lad
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; John answered, &ldquo;but when
you have no guns, why not use the bow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Wolf, he shoot bow&mdash;heap good,&rdquo;
said the Indian lad, whose own name, John afterward
discovered, was Flying Fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see him shoot,&rdquo; the white boy replied,
and Little Wolf, who was even then peeking in
at the door of the hut, while he held a bearskin
about him for warmth, quickly disappeared. In
a half minute, however, he returned bringing,
as John correctly guessed, his own bow and arrows.
They were like those Flying Fish had,
only quite elaborately ornamented with colors
dyed in the wood, showing that Little Wolf had
much pride in the weapons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Without a word the lad, who was of about the
same age as the other Indian boy, laid off the
bearskin he wore, leaving his shoulders bare to
the biting cold. (His lower limbs and waist
were clothed in leggins and trousers.) He
threw back his head, shaking his long hair away
from his face and eyes, and while John intently
watched him, pointed to a leaf on the outermost
branch of an oak tree, fifty feet or more from
the ground and as many yards from where he
stood. With careful aim he drew the string and
bent the bow, which, being very stiff and strong,
required much strength.</p>
<p>For a second he paused as the tip of the arrow
rested on the bow-center, then suddenly
sent the shaft flying so quickly and swiftly that
the white boy nearly missed seeing it. Straight
and true the arrow sped, piercing the leaf on
the bough of the oak and carrying it off as
neatly as if it had been plucked by hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>In genuine astonishment and admiration,
John gave his leg a vigorous slap, and diving
his hand into his pocket found a small bone
comb which he presented to Little Wolf then
and there; and to prevent hard feelings he gave
Flying Fish a similar present.</p>
<p>So pleased were the Indian lads and so
friendly after receiving these gifts, that it occurred
to John to improve the opportunity to
see what he could learn from them about the
prowling Redskin who seemed ever to seek and
lose no chance to kill and scalp white hunters,
always traveling alone, and, as Gentle Maiden
had said, carrying on &ldquo;his own war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killdeer, young Long-knife says,&rdquo; Flying
Fish explained to Little Wolf, who seemed not
to understand at once to whom the white boy referred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that his name? He is not a Delaware, is
he? He is not one of Captain Pipe&rsquo;s people?&rdquo;
John asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killdeer, he comes quick&mdash;like wind; gone&mdash;like
wind. No one see him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>And hard as John tried to draw further information
about the mysterious Indian from
the savage youths, he could learn nothing additional.
They gave evasive answers or failed, or
pretended to fail, to understand him.</p>
<p>Half inclined to be cross at the youngsters,
though they amused him not a little, John
changed the subject and made the boys promise
to hunt with bows and arrows and to bring peltries
to the cabin to exchange for knives and
trinkets.</p>
<p>His chief object in this was to persuade the
lads to do some hunting and thus provide food
for themselves and others of the Delaware
town; and even had he thought of the future, he
could not have known, as none can tell what
even the next day or hour will bring forth, what
an important part Flying Fish and Little Wolf
would play in connection with his own well-being,
as a result of his kindly interest in them.
For as it afterward happened it was solely because
of their having been instigated to go in
quest of game with only such weapons as they
possessed, that they made their appearance at
a distant point one day when their young white
friend greatly needed them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Gentle Maiden and the Quaker had finished
the distribution of dried venison brought from
the cabin by the time John had concluded his
talk with the two Indian lads and others who
clustered around to see and to hear, and as an
early homeward start was desirable, John suggested
to Mr. Hatch that they would better be
going.</p>
<p>No word had yet been received at the Delaware
town from Captain Pipe and there was no
knowing when he would be home. However,
provisions sufficient to last the Indians three or
four days had now been furnished them, and
there would be no necessity of visiting the town
so soon again. Yet the Quaker, whose whole
heart was in this work of teaching and caring
for the Indians, which he had taken upon himself,
told Gentle Maiden he would come again
the next day, as they bade the girl and the people
of the snow-bound village good-bye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>As when on their journey to the town Mr.
Hatch and his dapple-gray led the way, so did
they take the lead in traveling homeward. The
wind had risen again, but the path broken in
the morning was not yet filled in with the snow
and very good progress was made. The short
day, however, was near its close and the gloom
of the coming night settled down in the silent
forest while the strangely mated travelers were
still three miles or more from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have some news to tell Ree&mdash;the fact
that the mysterious Indian&rsquo;s name is Killdeer
and that he is a friend of Captain Pipe, who
for some reason doesn&rsquo;t mind who he kills,&rdquo;
John was thinking as he rode carelessly along,
when the Quaker called out to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware of the strange savage who desireth
only to kill, and hath no courage in him&mdash;always
shooting from behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got you marked up on his arm as already
dead, you know, Mr. Hatch, and you
should be in no danger,&rdquo; John laughingly
called in reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>But barely had he finished the sentence when
he was seized from behind and a dirty hand was
clasped so quickly and tightly over his mouth
that he could not utter a sound. Vainly he
struggled, but he was dragged down into the
snow and could not release himself.</p>
<p>So occupied was John in doing his best to escape,
or at least to cry out in warning to the
Quaker, that he did not see what had happened
to his companion.</p>
<p>The facts were that Mr. Hatch&rsquo;s mare, being
very much more sensitive and alert than slow-going
Neb, had suddenly shied upon passing a
large poplar tree, and as a man sprang from
behind it to seize him, as another seized John,
the horse gave so violent a leap forward that
the fellow grasped only at the air, though his
intended victim was almost thrown from the
saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>The old gentleman looked around, and seeing
John&rsquo;s horse, startled from its slow walk to a
gallop, coming up behind, and having no doubt
that the boy was lying low on the animal&rsquo;s back
to escape whatever danger threatened, he gave
his mare free rein. On and on he hastened
through the snow, followed by the frightened
unridden horse, nor did he stop until, dazed by
excitement, the dapple-gray panting and perspiring
as though it were a hot day in July, he
drew up at the cabin door.</p>
<p>Meanwhile John&rsquo;s captor had been reinforced
by the fellow who had failed to catch the
Quaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice mess you made of the job, I must
say!&rdquo; angrily growled the man who held John
down, the lad&rsquo;s face buried in the snow, as the
other man came up.</p>
<p>By a vigorous squirm, rising partly on his
hands and knees, John succeeded in turning
over and getting his first look at the fellow who
had seized him. Instantly he recognized the
&ldquo;Indian&rdquo; who had visited the cabin, still in Indian
costume, though there was no doubt that
his skin was white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is you, is it, Duff?&rdquo; said the boy
calmly as he could. &ldquo;I would recognize your
angelic temper anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Duff paid no attention to the remark, save to
hold his captive the tighter, but continued to
upbraid his companion for failing to secure the
&ldquo;blasted, pious old fool of a Quaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no use jawin&rsquo;; nobody never did nothin&rsquo;
what they couldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; the other man made
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, too, Dexter,&rdquo; John spoke up.
&ldquo;We had a nice visit with Mr. Duff, the other
evening, and wished you could have come along.
And how is it that Landlord Quilling is not with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SEARCH.</span></h2>
<p>The feelings of Return Kingdom when he saw
the Quaker come galloping up to the cabin door,
his beloved mare wet with perspiration, and
closely followed by their own horse, riderless,
were different than he had ever experienced.
He had never known the true meaning of fear
and never had he known a moment when his
courage and hope seemed to desert him so entirely
as now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>There flashed upon his mind a picture of
John Jerome&rsquo;s body stretched in the snow as
he had seen Quilling&rsquo;s; of the lone Indian stooping
over it to secure the awful trophy of his silent
warfare against the whites. With his old-time
determination, however, the lad shook off
these fearful thoughts, and as Theodore
Hatch&rsquo;s feet touched the ground, was at his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ree could not ask the question in his mind.
His voice sunk to a husky whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, I do not know,&rdquo; said the Quaker in
hushed, frightened tones. &ldquo;I thought he was
on his horse until but a little while ago. An Indian
attacked me and I escaped. I thought thy
friend was coming on behind till I chanced to
look back, a mile from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it just as quick as you
can, Mr. Hatch.&rdquo; There was pleading and yet
an imperative command in Kingdom&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were midway betwixt here and the Indian
town, but I scarce know what happened.
A savage in hiding behind a tree leaped out
upon me and would have seized me but Ph&oelig;be
bounded beyond his reach, nor stopped till now.
Thy beloved friend was behind me. His horse
kept close up and I thought the lad was with me
till but a few minutes since.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were no guns fired? Did you hear John
cry out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, I know not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that John was swept off his horse
by the low limbs of a tree,&rdquo; said Ree, hope coming
to him with the thought. &ldquo;Was it the lone
Indian&mdash;the one you saw before, who attacked
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say&mdash;I cannot say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Quaker was trembling violently from his
exertion and fright, and Ree pitied him, though
he almost despised the man who could give only
so wretched an account of what had happened,
when information was so badly needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mount your mare and come after me. Show
me the place where you were attacked.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Kingdom seized his rifle, which was always
within reach, and at one bound was upon Neb&rsquo;s
back. The Quaker began a protest, but the lad
did not&mdash;would not&mdash;hear. It was now quite
dark and the howling wind and penetrating cold
added to the hardship of the work to be done
and lessened the likelihood of success; but the
man dared not disobey the boy&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>The sweeping gale was fast filling in the path
the horses had made along the trail to the Indian
town, but the animals themselves were able
to find it, though in the darkness the men would
not have been. The Quaker recollected the
point at which he had first missed John and
there Ree dismounted and walked. But it was
no use; for, though often he mistook a half-buried
log or stump for the body of him he
sought, he discovered nothing in the darkness
which would indicate whether John had been
killed or carried off, or had only fallen,
wounded, from his horse.</p>
<p>Not until they had reached the village of the
Delawares did the searchers pause in their
hunt. Theodore Hatch had been unable to locate
definitely the spot at which he was attacked,
and Ree pushed on to the Indian town hoping
to find some tidings. But neither Gentle
Maiden nor any of the others could give any information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has the lone Indian been seen near here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question revealed Ree&rsquo;s secret fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not been here,&rdquo; the girl answered.
&ldquo;Gentle Maiden would tell the white brother if
he had come or gone. His hate is deep, his gun
shoots straight. His war is his own war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was sadness in the Indian maiden&rsquo;s
voice which betrayed her own fears. Thus did
she confirm her white friend&rsquo;s belief that John
had fallen a victim of the solitary savage whose
thirst for revenge upon the whites knew no
limit.</p>
<p>What was the reason of the bitter, personal,
persistent warfare he carried on? In his heart,
as the thoughts stirred his kindly nature to
vengefulness, Ree vowed that he would not quit
the country of the Ohio until he had killed this
lone Indian, and without John he would remain
no longer than he should need to complete that
task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The Quaker would have remained in the Indian
village for the remainder of the night, and
the Indians, roused from their slumbers by the
arrival of the white men, invited Ree, also, to
stay, but he would not think of it. Back along
the trail, therefore, the boy walking, the Quaker
astride his mare, the two plodded the weary
miles to the cabin again, searching all the way
for the body they dreaded to find.</p>
<p>Ree fed the jaded horses when home was
reached, and the exhausted Quaker, lying down,
was soon asleep, hugging his prized saddle bags
with one arm beneath his pillow, as usual.</p>
<p>For the younger man there was no rest. He
put the rude snowshoes he had made, in order,
and broiled and ate portions of a wild turkey he
had caught in the deep snow while making the
rounds of their traps in the absence of his chum
and Mr. Hatch during the day. He reloaded his
two pistols and refilled his powder horn and
bullet pouch, then waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Impatiently he spent the remaining hour or
two until the first sign of daylight, and then,
awakening the Quaker, cautioned him to remain
near the cabin and watch closely for any indication
of danger. He feared that Duff and
Dexter might chance to visit the vicinity, and
knew they would not hesitate to kill the old gentleman,
to procure his portion of the divided
fortune letter, if they found him alone.</p>
<p>The morning was breaking over the bleak,
wintry forest as Ree set forth. With two pistols
in his belt, his rifle over his shoulder and food
and medicine in the pouch hung at his side, he
had no concern for his own safety; but he did
fear deeply for one he loved more.</p>
<p>He went at once along the trail toward the
Indian town, closely scrutinizing the drifted
snow and the trees and bushes on both sides
thereof. Nowhere did he find the least encouragement
until he came to a great poplar tree
about which there was evidence that the snow
had been disturbed and tramped down the day
before, though the traces were now well-nigh
obliterated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>The place answered to the meager description
Theodore Hatch had given of the spot at which
the assault was made, but in his uncertainty the
anxious boy knew but one thing to do. He hurried
on, resolving, if he found no better clue, to
return and look far and wide about this spot in
hope of discovering some sign of tracks leading
away from it.</p>
<p>With desperate haste the unhappy boy traversed
the trail clear back to the Delaware
town. The Indians were astir and two boys,
Flying Fish and Little Wolf, were preparing to
go hunting with bows and arrows. They were
equipped with snowshoes and ready for a long
journey. Both offered to join the &ldquo;white
brother&rdquo; in his search, but Ree thanked them
and told them only that if they discovered any
trace of the missing one to carry word to the
town and the cabin as quickly as they could.
He would reward them well, he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Without loss of time the anxious lad then returned
to the big poplar tree beside the trail.
Half the forenoon had passed, but the day had
come bright and clear with scarcely any wind.
It would have been a glorious day for hunting,
but any day must be gloomy when one&rsquo;s best
friend is strangely missing, and may be dead or
dying, and there was no sunshine in the heart
of the lonely boy who traversed the snow-bound
forest.</p>
<p>At last, a quarter of a mile to the right of the
point where the trail passed the big poplar, Ree
did discover, in a protected valley, the tracks
of three persons. Minutely he examined them,
but the fine snow had so sifted in that he could
not tell whether they were those of Indians or
otherwise, or whether or not John might have
made any of the footprints. He hastened in the
direction in which they led, however, though
surprised to see that they would pass only a
mile or so to the eastward from the cabin, unless
the course changed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>As a more open portion of the forest was
reached, the last evidence of the tracks disappeared.
Still Ree kept on. He saw that he
would come out somewhere in the sheltered valley
of the Cuyahoga, if he continued in the direction
he had first taken, and if he found no
one in hiding there, as he believed he might,
since the valley gave protection from the winds
and snow, he might at least discover the lost
trail there, in some of the sheltered places.</p>
<p>As time proved, Ree&rsquo;s decision was wise. He
had gone scarcely a half mile farther when he
came upon fresh tracks in the snow. They were
those of but two persons apparently, and of Indians,
the young pioneer believed; but he remembered
that frequently in traveling Indians
take great care to step in the footprints of one
another and thus conceal their real number
from any one discovering their trail, and he took
up this fresh clue at increased speed. Five
minutes later he caught sight of two figures
ahead of him. One was a white man, he judged
from the dress, the other an Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, brothers! What&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo; the
boy called.</p>
<p>The men stopped and looked back. Both
were Indians, Ree then saw, though one was
dressed in the clothing of a white man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; called one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Fox&mdash;white brother&mdash;how?&rdquo; the
other of the Redmen exclaimed, and Ree then
recognized them as Long Arrow and Beaver
Hair, the Mingoes whom he had caught in the
act of stealing the canoe he and John had purchased
the year before of Captain Pipe. Moreover,
he discovered, as he approached, that the
fellow in white men&rsquo;s clothing was wearing the
identical suit which he had seen the robber,
Duff, wear. It was easy to guess then how Duff
had come by the Indian costume he wore on his
recent visit to the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me where I will find the white brother
with whom you traded clothes,&rdquo; said Ree, as he
shook hands with the Indians. &ldquo;His name is
Duff and he now wears the dress of the Mingo
for no good purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; was the only answer the Indians
made. They could not understand how the
white lad could tell at once with whom the exchange
had been made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;No see Spotted Face&mdash;Spotted Face no
friend of young brother White Fox,&rdquo; said Long
Arrow, who wore Duff&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>It was Duff whom he called &ldquo;Spotted Face,&rdquo;
referring to the marks the smallpox had left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spotted Face ask Long Arrow and ask
Beaver Hair to burn house of white brothers,&rdquo;
put in the other Indian. &ldquo;Say white brother
killed Black Eagle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was news of a very interesting kind.
Duff, then, had been trying to turn these two
Indians against himself and John, had he?
These were Ree&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spotted Face say give heap firewater&mdash;heap
money&mdash;for Long Arrow and Beaver Hair to
carry off white brother and hide him in cave
where Spotted Face has his bed,&rdquo; Long Arrow
said.</p>
<p>This was more interesting news. Duff, it may
have been, had kidnaped John, after having
failed to prevail upon the Indians to do it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;And my Mingo friends would not do so,&rdquo;
Ree answered, shaking hands with the savages
again. &ldquo;I thank you both; and Spotted
Face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tongue of Spotted Face speaks crooked&mdash;crooked
as snakes when asleep,&rdquo; said Beaver
Hair, referring to serpents which lie coiled
when sunning themselves. &ldquo;Because Killdeer&mdash;him
you call the lone Indian&mdash;saw Spotted Face
kill Black Eagle. Young white brother not kill
Black Eagle. Killdeer saw him die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What in the world would he next hear of this
marvelous lone Indian who seemed in all places
at all times? So thought Ree, deeply impressed
by the pointed climax his Indian friends had
reached. Inwardly, as the thought flew upon
his mind, he thanked fortune that the vanishing
savage had at least been the means of
thwarting the design of the unscrupulous Duff
to turn these Mingoes against himself and John,
by telling them of the cruel murder of kind old
Black Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Duff&mdash;Spotted Face&mdash;know that Killdeer
saw him strike the Black Eagle down?&rdquo;
Ree asked, glad to know the name of the solitary
savage, at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>The Indians shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killdeer get him bime-by,&rdquo; said Long Arrow
significantly. &ldquo;Killdeer&rsquo;s war is his own
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here was still more to set Ree to thinking&mdash;two
Mingoes, not especially friendly with
the Delawares, saying of the lone Indian just as
Gentle Maiden had said, &ldquo;His war is his own
war.&rdquo; What was the secret of it all? He asked
Long Arrow and he asked Beaver Hair then
and there. Neither would answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killdeer has not shot at me nor at your
other white brother for a long time,&rdquo; said Ree.
&ldquo;Has he no war against us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Killdeer has,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;He
be heap bad&mdash;kill anybody&mdash;get many scalps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>This was not very pleasant information, but
time was passing and Ree could not press his
inquiries further. He asked the Indians
whether they had seen the trail of any persons
in the woods, and they answered that they had
not. He told them briefly then of John&rsquo;s disappearance,
but they did not volunteer to help him
in his search, and bidding them good-bye, he
hastened on, eating some dried venison as he
went.</p>
<p>The unhappy lad&rsquo;s mind was filled with conflicting
thoughts. Was it the mysterious savage,
Killdeer, or was it Duff who had attacked
John and the Quaker? Why should Duff have
wished to have John kidnaped? The questions
were still puzzling him when suddenly he
discovered another freshly-made trail in the
snow. The tracks were those of a man, but
whether Indian or Paleface he could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A white man, I should guess from their
size,&rdquo; the boy was saying to himself, &ldquo;Indians
nearly always have small&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of Duff, and as Ree looked
up, startled by the unexpected command, he
gazed at the muzzle of a rifle in the hands of
that scoundrel, not a score of yards distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hunting you this good while, and
now, by the eternal, I&rsquo;ve got ye,&rdquo; the villain
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CAVE OF THE FORTUNE HUNTERS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Duff who spoke, and he accompanied
the command with a volley of oaths.</p>
<p>In wonderfully quick time Duff went through
John&rsquo;s pockets and the pouch which hung at
his belt, taking everything he found, which,
fortunately, was nothing more than a hunting
knife and pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take his gun and push out fast, ahead,
Dexter. I&rsquo;ll follow close behind, and you,
young fellow, keep just behind your good
friend here, and just ahead of me, and attempt
no monkey business, or I&rsquo;ll blow your brains
out! Now, march!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>With a quick glance around to get his bearings,
John walked off as Dexter led the way.
He noticed regretfully that it was now quite
dark in the woods, and the wind was again
blowing so hard that their tracks through the
snow would be quickly obscured.</p>
<p>For hours, it seemed to John, the silent
march continued. At first he knew just where
he was, but as it became darker and wolves
howled not only on one but on all sides, and
the wind swirled and swept so in all directions
that he could not keep his bearings, he lost
all knowledge of his whereabouts except to
know that he was in a very unpleasant predicament,
to say the least, and he wished
heartily that he was out of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>It was almost midnight, as nearly as John
could judge, when, after winding in and out
for some time through dark ravines, whose
rocky walls rose high above their heads, making
the darkness so intense that they could
scarcely see the snow at their feet, Duff and
Dexter mounted to a rough ledge four or five
feet above the level of the valley in which they
were, and dragged their captive up after them.
He knew at once, as he found a low, rocky
roof above his head, that they were in the
mouth of a cave of some sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a light,&rdquo; commanded Duff, and
stepping forward he seized John&rsquo;s arm, as if
afraid the boy might attempt to escape.</p>
<p>Dexter, obedient to his chief&rsquo;s order, knelt
in the darkness and by much puffing and
blowing kindled a small fire from a few live
coals remaining of a blaze the two men
evidently had left when starting out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get something to eat,&rdquo; was the next order
of the captain, and Dexter slunk away to another
part of the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>While he waited by Duff&rsquo;s side John made
as thorough an inspection of the cave as he
could by the flickering firelight. It did not
appear very deep though the roof was twice
as high as a man, and its yawning mouth
extended nearly its entire width of probably
twenty feet. Still comparatively little snow
had drifted in and the floor was dry and hard.
In one corner not far from the fire was a pile
of leaves on which some skins and blankets
were spread, while hanging on the forks of a
sapling cut off half way up and now leaning
against the wall, were a frying pan and other
cooking utensils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of ghost-like around here,&rdquo; the boy
remarked, smiling grimly as the firelight cast
spectral shadows in the deeper parts of the
cavern and upon the rough walls. &ldquo;Seems to
me I can see the ghosts of Quilling and Black
Eagle right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dry up! Blast your noisy tongue, dry up!&rdquo;
growled Duff beneath his breath, while involuntarily
he shuddered and glanced around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a guilty conscience,&rdquo; thought
John, mentally resolving to make use of this
discovery that his captor was afraid of ghosts,
if the opportunity came to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Their meager supper of venison over, Dexter,
at Duff&rsquo;s command&mdash;it seemed that the
former was obliged to do all the physical
labor&mdash;brought stout thongs of twisted buckskin
and John was speedily bound hand and
foot, and then pushed and thrown upon the
bed of leaves and skins in the corner. Duff
and Dexter also lay down, one on either side
of the prisoner.</p>
<p>It was daylight when John awoke, the bonds
upon his wrists and ankles instantly, painfully
reminding him of where he was and bringing
to his mind the unhappy recollection of all
that had happened. Neither Duff nor Dexter
was on the bed beside him, and, rolling over,
he looked around. There sat Dexter on the
log by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; called John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest don&rsquo;t you say nothin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m to knock
yer blasted brains out if ye holler, er say a
word. Them&rsquo;s Duff&rsquo;s own words. Lay still
an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t do ye no
harm, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll git ye a bite to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying Dexter sliced off a few cuts of
meat from a nearly consumed fore quarter of
a deer and prepared it for the prisoner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was too bad Quilling was killed the way
he was,&rdquo; said John, as he ate, wishing to appear
friendly, for he believed Dexter was not
at heart nearly so villainous as his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bub, jest you shet up. Ye ain&rsquo;t allowed
to say nothin&rsquo;. Them&rsquo;s the orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after a pause of several minutes, Dexter
added: &ldquo;Duff didn&rsquo;t say as I couldn&rsquo;t talk
none, though, an&rsquo; I kin say yes, &rsquo;twas too bad
as Quilling got killed. But it was his own
fault. When Duff goes to yer hut as an Injun,
plannin&rsquo; to get what he was after, an&rsquo; left me
an&rsquo; Quilling at the edge o&rsquo; the woods t&rsquo; help
him if he needed it, or to draw you chaps out
some way, an&rsquo; give him a better chance, if he
didn&rsquo;t come back by midnight, Quilling an&rsquo;
me stood under a tree with low limbs where
we wouldn&rsquo;t be seen by anybody. Then Quilling
got scared&mdash;allus was a blamed baby anyhow,&mdash;an&rsquo;
he begun to chatter an&rsquo; talk &rsquo;bout
how he wished he had stayed to home. &lsquo;An&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to holler to Duff this minute that I
want t&rsquo; go home an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got t&rsquo; go with
me,&rsquo; he says, speakin&rsquo; up loud. An&rsquo; with
that he steps out into the clearin&rsquo;, when
&lsquo;bang!&rsquo; he tumbled over like a rabbit, an&rsquo; in
a jiffy there come pouncin&rsquo; onto him a devil
of an Injun that has been hangin&rsquo; round
these parts a long time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; this Injun ain&rsquo;t no nat&rsquo;ral critter at
all. He comes an&rsquo; goes too quick fer that.
He&rsquo;s a Injun witch, that&rsquo;s what he is, an&rsquo;
&rsquo;fore I knew it I was yellin&rsquo; &lsquo;help,&rsquo; an&rsquo; hootin&rsquo;
like a owl, which was the sign agreed
on to call Duff out if we had to have him;
an&rsquo; then I goes racin&rsquo; into the woods like
all get out. Duff comes runnin&rsquo; after me,
cursin&rsquo; awful, he was that mad. But he knew
Quilling was a goner an&rsquo; we&mdash;we jest lit out
fer our cave here. We was watchin&rsquo; from the
woods when you an&rsquo; the Quaker chap started
out to the Injun town an&rsquo; then it was that
Duff says we would ketch ye, an&rsquo; we did, an&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s next to be did is fer me to know an&rsquo;
you to find out, as the sayin&rsquo; is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>John, it is sure, was greatly interested in
what he had heard. And now, as Dexter
showed no signs of speaking further, though
he seemed to like to hear his own tongue going,
the captive tried hard to think of some seemingly
innocent question or remark which
would start the fellow talking once more. At
last he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest truth, Mr. Dexter, I was not spying
on you that night away back at the Eagle tavern
when I went for a drink of water and
found you and Duff and Quilling reading a
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;Young feller, you keep still. Don&rsquo;t you
say nothin&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s what! But ye needn&rsquo;t
think Duff lays it up ag&rsquo;in ye that ye came
onto us sudden-like that night at Quilling&rsquo;s
place. He don&rsquo;t remember nothin&rsquo; about it,
I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose. Why, him an&rsquo; me had only
got to Quilling&rsquo;s that same night; an&rsquo; of
course we didn&rsquo;t know what Quilling wanted
till we got there. He was jest a-goin&rsquo; to show
us that letter or piece o&rsquo; one, when you chaps
come along. Quilling didn&rsquo;t know himself
jest what the thing meant, but he knew it
told about money buried in the ground an&rsquo;
he knew that this chap Nesbit had done good
business liftin&rsquo; jew&rsquo;lry an&rsquo; coin from folks
along the roads an&rsquo; places. He knew enough
to guess pretty straight as how Duff would be
the man to help find the other part of the
letter, &rsquo;cause he had seen Nesbit have it, an&rsquo;
he sent fer him, an&rsquo; Duff an&rsquo; me went together.
But while yer talkin&rsquo;, boy, only ye ain&rsquo;t allowed
to talk none, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll knock yer blasted
brains out if ye do, this here ain&rsquo;t my reg&rsquo;lar
trade, an&rsquo; I vow, if there&rsquo;s much more killin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; slavin&rsquo; fer Duff, I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; quit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dexter paused and put a few sticks of wood
on the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;bout time Duff was comin&rsquo; back,&rdquo; he
said, as he sat down again. &ldquo;Duff&rsquo;s gone to
hunt yer pardner an&rsquo; if he don&rsquo;t give him what
he wants, he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to knock yer blasted
brains out an&rsquo; scalp ye jest the same as though
that Injun witch had did it, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be laid
onto the Injun. Duff&rsquo;s wrote a letter on bark
with charcoal that says that, an&rsquo; now ye know
what yer chances be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John was far from comfortable as he learned
Duff&rsquo;s monstrous plan. He could not believe
that Ree would surrender the letter, which was
not his property, but the property of Theodore
Hatch, without a struggle, and he knew that
Duff would not hesitate to kill. The result, it
was all too likely, would be that Duff, in one
of his furious passions would commit murder
and John Jerome would never greet his friends
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see I was jest a farm hand an&rsquo; never
was in the line as Duff was in, until he got me
into this one, sayin&rsquo; it would only be a job of
findin&rsquo; a box o&rsquo; gold buried in the ground, an&rsquo;
I could handle a spade so good,&rdquo; Dexter continued,
talking as though to himself. &ldquo;But
it ain&rsquo;t been like he said. I ain&rsquo;t no coward
like Quilling, but if this here scheme Duff&rsquo;s
now workin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t do the business, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
to quit&mdash;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to quit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Dexter shook his head gloomily. It was undoubtedly
a &ldquo;blue&rdquo; day for him. He rose and
walked out just beyond the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to quit,&rdquo; the fellow murmured
despondently again, and his words were as a
prophecy.</p>
<p>From a clump of bushes above, at the top of
the steep hill across the ravine, clearly visible
through the bare, gray trees, there came a puff
of smoke; a rifle sounded, and Dexter, shading
his eyes with one hand, looking down the
valley in search of Duff, whom he would see
never again, sprang high into the air. As
though it were some inanimate thing his body
fell backward at full length upon the ground,
and from his temple trickled a tiny stream of
crimson, staining the snow.</p>
<p>So ended the life of Dexter. If the thrilling
adventures that awaited John Jerome, his
prisoner, and Return Kingdom on the edge of
civilization urge you to further reading, turn
with me the pages of &ldquo;<i>The Lone Indian</i>&rdquo; that
together we may learn the full history of the
little cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
